    {
      "Concept": "Grid Systems",
      "Definition": "A distributed computing model that connects computers over a network to share resources, typically using MPI for data sharing and X.509 certificates for access control.",

        "Focuses on distributing the workload across multiple nodes.",

        "Has less interoperability between providers compared to Grid systems.",

  "Overall_Summary": "Grid systems distribute workloads across multiple nodes using tools like MPI, while cloud systems offer pay-per-use elasticity with standard protocols. Grids use X.509 certificates for access, whereas clouds shift to a more flexible and scalable model without the need for such certificates.",
