## Teaching Module: Security Responsibility Division
1. The Story (Problem → Solution → Impact)

---

The Problem (Event): Imagine you're the IT manager of a small company using cloud services to store and manage your data. You've noticed that there are times when employees tend to share their passwords, or worse, use weak ones without realizing the risks it poses for data security. The responsibility for securing data is unclear and leads to confusion about who should take action against these vulnerabilities.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): One day, a cloud provider representative comes in to talk about how they handle data protection on their end. They explain that while they provide the infrastructure, services, and platform needed for secure operations, users are ultimately responsible for securing their data by following best practices and purchasing/leasing security services from providers.

The Impact (Meaning): This concept is crucial because it clarifies who's accountable for what in a cloud environment. It ensures that users understand their roles and responsibilities, which is essential for maintaining data integrity and compliance with regulations. By dividing the responsibility between users and cloud service providers, both can leverage their strengths to enhance overall security effectively.

2. Storytelling Hooks:

---

Dramatic Question: "What if we could share the burden of securing our digital assets by working together?" 

Point of View: From the perspective of a user who wants to ensure data is secure without having to bear all the responsibility themselves.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

---

Pacing: As you discuss this concept, take time to answer questions and address concerns from students about how it works in practice.

Analogy: Imagine a three-legged race where cloud providers are one leg and users are the other two. Though both legs have to move together for everyone to win, each leg still has its specific role in keeping the entire team on track.

### Interactive Activities for Security Responsibility Division
1. Debate Topic: "Is it better for organizations to rely solely on internal employees or external security providers in managing data security?"
Strengths of this topic include encouraging critical thinking about the strengths and weaknesses of the Security Responsibility Division, while also allowing students to engage with real world issues related to securing information. Weaknesses may be that some students may not have prior knowledge about the concept, making it difficult for them to fully participate in the debate.
2. 'What If' Scenario Question: "If a company adopts a shared responsibility model for security but fails to properly educate its employees on best practices, how does this impact their data security?" This scenario encourages students to think critically about the role of education and training in maintaining secure systems while also drawing attention to potential trade-offs when implementing the Security Responsibility Division.

## Teaching Module: IAM Framework
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

---

In today's digital world, businesses rely heavily on cloud computing to store and process sensitive data. One such company is ABC Inc., which has migrated its operations to the cloud to save costs and increase efficiency. However, as their business grows, they realize that managing user identities and access controls has become increasingly complex. They face a challenge of maintaining security while allowing employees to easily collaborate on projects and share information.

One day, after a series of incidents where unauthorized users gained access to sensitive data, the company's IT team embarks on an exciting journey to find a solution that can help them manage access in the cloud more effectively. Little did they know, their 'Aha!' moment was just around the corner.

---

**The Aha! Moment (Experience)**: 

Identity and Access Management, or IAM for short, is a critical component of cloud security for managing user identities and access controls. It works by implementing least privilege principles, which means that users are granted only the minimal necessary permissions to perform their job functions while keeping sensitive data secure from unauthorized access. This can be achieved through various methods such as password-based authentication, multi-factor authentication, or even integrating with external identity providers like Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: 

IAM frameworks are essential because they help prevent unauthorized access to cloud resources by ensuring that only authorized users have the necessary permissions. By implementing IAM, companies can reduce the risk of data breaches and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR or HIPAA. However, it is important to note that IAM can be complex to implement and manage, especially in large organizations where user identities are abundant.

---

2. Storytelling Hooks:
* Dramatic Question: "What's the best way for companies like ABC Inc. to maintain their data security while allowing employees to collaborate efficiently?"
* Point of View: "From the perspective of a company trying to balance cloud access control and productivity."

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

**Pacing**: Pause at key points during the story, such as when the IT team discovers IAM or after implementing it successfully. This will allow for questions from students about what they're hearing and encourage them to engage with the content.

**Analogy**: Imagine IAM like a security guard at an entrance of a large building. They only let authorized people enter, ensuring everyone else stays out and keeping the building safe. Similarly, in cloud computing, IAM acts as the 'security guard,' managing user identities and access controls for the organization's sensitive data and resources.

### Interactive Activities for IAM Framework
1. Debate Topic: The IAM Framework's Robust Access Control vs Implementation Complexity in Large Organizations

Statement: Despite the robust mechanism provided by IAM for controlling access to cloud resources, it is too complex to implement effectively in large organizations.

Strengths Argument: The IAM framework provides a comprehensive and secure way of managing user access rights within the cloud environment, making it ideal for smaller businesses or teams with limited resource requirements. Its granular control allows administrators to tailor permissions according to specific needs, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data.

Weaknesses Argument: In large organizations with extensive network structures, implementing IAM can be a daunting task due to its complexity and the need for significant investments in time, resources, and personnel training. The lengthy setup process and ongoing management required may cause delays in other crucial projects or hinder productivity gains from cloud adoption. Furthermore, as companies grow and require more intricate access control scenarios, managing user access rights becomes increasingly complex with IAM.

1. What If Scenario Question: "If your organization had implemented the IAM Framework instead of a simpler authentication system, how would you address the following scenario?"

Scenario: The company has been using a simple authentication method to protect its cloud environment for years without any major issues. However, recently an employee was fired and it was discovered that they have accessed sensitive data from their previous position. If your organization had implemented IAM instead of this simpler system, how would you prevent similar occurrences in the future?

## Teaching Module: Data Safeguarding in Different Service Models
1. The Story (Problem  ->  Solution  ->  Impact)

---

Based on this scenario, imagine you're managing a business that handles sensitive customer data. You have three cloud service providers offering different types of services: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Each provider offers varying levels of security measures for the infrastructure they manage. 

You're eager to work with one of these cloud providers, but you're not sure which service model is best suited for your company. You want to ensure that your data remains secure throughout its journey within each service model. This leads you on a quest to learn more about how different security measures apply in each cloud service model and how it can impact the overall protection of your business's sensitive customer data.

---

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: 

Once you dive into understanding these three cloud service models, you quickly realize that managing data safety is not a one-size-fits-all solution. In IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), users are responsible for securing the operating system and applications running on virtual machines. This means you would have to make sure your security measures cover all aspects of these systems.

Meanwhile, PaaS providers typically handle application-level security but not infrastructure or data security. So in this case, you must take care of the protection of your applications and their underlying infrastructure. 

Lastly, SaaS providers manage all aspects of the application, including data storage and access control. This means they are responsible for securing every aspect of your software as a service provider.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: 

Understanding these differences in security measures is crucial because it helps you to allocate appropriate resources and focus on securing the right parts of your cloud environment. By doing so, you can achieve tailored protection based on each service model's specific needs. This understanding empowers you to make informed decisions about which provider will best suit your business requirements while maintaining the highest level of data security.

However, it also poses a challenge because users must have deep knowledge and understanding of each cloud service model’s security features. It might be challenging for some individuals or businesses who lack experience in these areas. 

---

### Classroom Delivery Tips:

**Pacing**: Pause here to allow students to process the information about the three different service models and their corresponding data safety measures.

**Analogy**: Consider comparing cloud security to a lock system, with each key (service model) providing varying degrees of protection for your digital 'door' (data).

### Interactive Activities for Data Safeguarding in Different Service Models
1. Debate Topic: "Is it better for users to have a deep understanding of each service model's security features or for data safeguarding in different service models to be a one-size-fits-all approach?"

2. What If Scenario Question: Imagine that you are using an online shopping platform, and the company uses a 'one size fits all' approach to data safeguarding. During a recent cyber attack, it was discovered that the platform had inadequate security features for protecting sensitive financial information such as credit card numbers. Now, the company is considering adopting a more tailored approach based on different service models. As an informed user, would you support this change and argue in favor of having a deep understanding of each service model's security features to better protect your personal data?

* Pacing: As you introduce AWS Trusted Advisor in your lesson plan, consider pausing at critical points during the story for students to imagine how they might use this tool in their own cloud environments. Encourage them to think about potential scenarios where it could be helpful and when an engineer should act on its recommendations.

* Analogy: Imagine a virtual security guard stationed within your organization's digital assets, constantly monitoring activity and sounding alarms whenever suspicious behavior is detected. AWS Trusted Advisor functions similarly by providing real-time feedback on potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement in cloud environments.

### Interactive Activities for Auditing Tools
1. Debate Topic:
"Do automated auditing tools effectively manage security risks, or should manual reviews be prioritized in corporate environments?"
Strengths: Automated auditing tools offer continuous monitoring with minimal human intervention, enabling faster detection of potential threats and improved response times to security breaches. This allows organizations to maintain a high level of cybersecurity without relying on costly, experienced personnel.
Weaknesses: While automated tools reduce the risk of missed vulnerabilities, they do not replace the need for manual review or expert analysis. Users must still interpret recommendations provided by these tools, which may lead to errors in decision-making if users are unfamiliar with the technology's capabilities and limitations. Additionally, relying solely on automation can result in blind spots within a company's security posture since it does not account for human-specific vulnerabilities such as social engineering attacks or insider threats.
2. What If Scenario Question:
"Suppose you work at a small startup that has recently implemented an automated auditing tool to monitor its network security. Your CEO is convinced this will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access, while your IT team believes it's better to prioritize manual reviews for improved accuracy."
