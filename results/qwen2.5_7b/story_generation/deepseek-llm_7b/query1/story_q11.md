## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

---

The Problem (Event): Before the Shared Responsibility Model was introduced, cloud service providers were primarily responsible for security in their infrastructure. Users, on the other hand, had to worry about securing their data and applications, which often led to confusion over who was accountable for what. It became a challenge for users to ensure that they maintained adequate levels of security within the cloud environment, especially with limited resources or knowledge around best practices.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): The Shared Responsibility Model is designed as a way to clarify and divide responsibilities between cloud service providers and their users when it comes to maintaining cloud security. According to this model, both parties share the responsibility for different aspects of cloud security. Cloud service providers are responsible for securing their infrastructure, while users need to focus on protecting their data and applications.

The Impact (Meaning): The Shared Responsibility Model is significant because it creates a clear division of responsibilities that reduces ambiguity and ensures accountability. It highlights the importance of taking proactive measures by users in securing their data and applications within the cloud environment. However, it also poses some weaknesses as users may lack the necessary knowledge or resources to fully leverage these services effectively.

2. Storytelling Hooks:
- Dramatic Question: "Who is responsible for ensuring security in a cloud computing environment?"
- Point of View: From the perspective of an IT professional tasked with securing data and applications within the cloud.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:
- Pacing: Start by introducing the Shared Responsibility Model, then dive into the problem it solved before exploring its impact. Finally, conclude by discussing potential analogies or relatable scenarios to help students better understand the concept.
- Analogies: Imagine you're a baker using an online bakery platform for orders. Cloud service providers manage the infrastructure of the platform (e.g., servers and software), while as a user, you need to ensure that your order details and personal information remain secure on this shared platform. This analogy illustrates how both parties share responsibility when it comes to maintaining security within cloud-based services.

### Interactive Activities for Shared Responsibility Model
1. Debate Topic: "Shared Responsibility Model vs. Collaborative Community Approach - Which Is More Effective for Addressing Social Issues?"

Strengths of Shared Responsibility Model: Clear division of responsibilities, accountability, and efficiency in tackling social issues.
Weaknesses of Shared Responsibility Model: Lack of resources or knowledge among users to fully leverage the model's potential, potentially leading to suboptimal results.

2. What If Scenario Question: "A small town faces a severe water shortage due to drought. The local government has implemented the Shared Responsibility Model for distributing limited water supplies among households and businesses. However, some residents feel they are being unfairly treated by the distribution system, claiming it prioritizes certain groups over others. Given this scenario, what changes would you suggest to improve the efficiency of the shared responsibility model while also ensuring fairness in water allocation?"

## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management (IAM)
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

The Problem (Event): Imagine you're an HR manager at a large organization with multiple departments and teams working together to achieve common goals. You need access to all team members' data, including their personal information and sensitive work-related documents. However, not every member of your staff should have direct access to the company cloud storage system. Additionally, some employees might leave or be hired, requiring constant updates to permissions and access levels. This makes it difficult for you to manage who has access to what within your organization's cloud environment.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a solution that simplifies the process of managing user identities and their corresponding privileges on a platform or network, such as in a company's cloud storage system. It works by assigning roles to users based on their job responsibilities within the organization, allowing only those with specific access rights to view sensitive data.

The Impact (Meaning): IAM is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of resources because it enhances security by limiting access to authorized users and reducing the attack surface. It also helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements by ensuring that employees have access only to what they need. However, misconfigurations or weak policies can still lead to vulnerabilities, which makes it important for companies to invest in robust IAM solutions from providers who specialize in this field.

2. Storytelling Hooks:
* Dramatic Question: "Who would be able to access sensitive company data if we didn't have a system in place for managing user identities and permissions?"
* Point of View: "From the perspective of an IT security officer, it becomes crucial to implement IAM solutions that ensure only authorized personnel can access critical resources."

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:
* Pacing: When discussing IAM, take time to explain how users are responsible for securing their data by following best practices and purchasing/leasing services from providers.
* Analogy: Imagine you're in charge of a candy store with many shelves filled with different types of sweets that each have unique flavors and ingredients. You can only allow certain employees access to the shelf where the rare, expensive candies are stored because they know their value better than others who might not handle them as carefully or appreciate them as much.

### Interactive Activities for Identity/Access Management (IAM)
1. Debate Topic: "Does Identity Access Management improve cybersecurity or merely provide limited security?"

Statement: While Identity Access Management (IAM) enhances security by limiting access to only authorized users and reducing the attack surface, it still leaves room for vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations or weak policies. Strengthen your argument in favor of IAM being a robust solution against cyber threats. 

2. 'What If' Scenario Question: "In an organization that has implemented Identity Access Management (IAM), suppose they have recently suffered a data breach, and it was discovered that there were numerous unmanaged devices on the network connected to their system through weak passwords. How would this scenario affect the effectiveness of IAM in securing the organization?"

## Teaching Module: Data Protection Responsibilities
## The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

The Problem: In today's interconnected world, data is often stored and processed in cloud environments. This provides numerous benefits such as scalability and accessibility but also poses significant risks to sensitive information. A common concern among organizations using these services is who is responsible for securing their data? Are the providers or users solely responsible for protecting it?

The 'Aha' Moment: It turns out that responsibility varies based on the type of cloud service - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). In IaaS, customers are typically given root access to their virtual machines and applications. They must secure these systems themselves by implementing firewalls, encryption, and other security measures.

In PaaS, providers offer some level of data protection services but require users to configure and manage aspects like application security, user authentication, and access controls. With SaaS, the majority of responsibility falls on the provider since they handle server maintenance, patching, backups, and network infrastructure. But even in this case, it's crucial for customers to ensure proper configuration settings and usage guidelines are followed.

The Impact: Clear delineation of responsibilities helps identify appropriate measures needed to secure data. This understanding is essential not only from a compliance perspective (e.g., GDPR or HIPAA) but also for safeguarding sensitive information against unauthorized access, breaches, or theft. Properly securing data in cloud environments prevents costly and damaging consequences while ensuring that it remains confidential, intact, and accessible only to authorized parties.

## Storytelling Hooks:
- Dramatic Question: "Who is responsible for protecting your data stored on a cloud server?"
- Point of View: "From the perspective of an IT manager overseeing sensitive information."

## Classroom Delivery Tips:
1. Pacing: When discussing each type of cloud service, take time to explore examples and real-life scenarios that help illustrate the nuances of responsibility allocation. For example, when discussing IaaS, show a diagram or flowchart illustrating how users are responsible for securing their virtual machines and applications running on them.
2. Analogy: Data protection in cloud environments is like making sure your home is properly locked up at night - while you may be primarily responsible for the security of your house (IaaS), the landlord provides some level of safety measures (PaaS) or takes care of most of it (SaaS). But ultimately, securing your data should always fall within your control.

### Interactive Activities for Data Protection Responsibilities
1. Debate Topic: "Should all employees be responsible for data protection or should it solely fall under IT?"

The debate topic pits the strengths of clear delineation of responsibilities against the weakness of needing a good understanding of SLAs to ensure compliance. In this scenario, students can discuss whether it is better to assign specific responsibility areas to different departments and individuals within an organization (as recommended by the strength) or if data protection should fall under one centralized IT department (reflecting the weakness).

2. What If Scenario Question: "If a company's HR manager accidentally shares confidential employee information with the public, how would this impact the employees' trust in the organization and what measures could be taken to prevent it from happening again?"

The hypothetical scenario forces students to consider the consequences of sharing sensitive data without considering its implications for the affected individuals. They will have to analyze both strengths and weaknesses of the situation - while acknowledging that clear delineation of responsibilities is important, they must also take into account the need for IT-based knowledge in order to prevent such mishaps from occurring again in the future.
