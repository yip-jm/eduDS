1. The Story (Problem  ->   Solution  ->   Impact)

--

In the world of software development and deployment, one common challenge faced by developers was ensuring that their applications ran consistently across different environments. This meant spending countless hours configuring and tweaking each environment to meet application requirements. Imagine a developer working tirelessly on an important project, only for it to fail at runtime because the application couldn't access certain system resources due to differences in the underlying hardware or operating system. Frustrating, isn't it?

Enter containerization technologies as our 'Aha!' moment! These revolutionary tools brought about a new way of packaging software applications with their dependencies into what is essentially an isolated and consistent environment - like a miniature virtual machine - that can run on any compatible host system. This was truly groundbreaking news in the world of development, deployment, and operations teams.

Now imagine being able to ship your application as a container, ready to be deployed anywhere without having to worry about specific hardware or operating system requirements. No more sleepless nights spent configuring environments - you can focus on delivering value with your software! This is what truly matters in the world of high-performance computing (HPC), where performance and resource efficiency are critical.

## Teaching Module: Docker
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)
---------------------------------------

In the world of software development, there was a common problem that developers and IT professionals faced on a daily basis. They would spend countless hours setting up their development environments to ensure that they were consistent across different systems or machines. This process could be time-consuming and frustrating. It seemed as though no matter how much effort they put into it, the environments never quite matched each other perfectly.

One day, a new technology emerged on the horizon: Docker. The name itself was intriguing - like an enigmatic creature from a science fiction novel. This mysterious concept promised to solve the problem of inconsistent development environments by providing developers with a simple and consistent way to create, deploy, and manage their applications. Could this be the solution they had been searching for?

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
------------------------------

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. In essence, it allows developers to package up an application with all its dependencies into a single object that can be easily transported from one environment to another without any issues related to compatibility or consistency. This means that once your development environment is set up using Docker, you will have a consistent platform for testing and deploying your applications across different systems.

The Impact (Meaning)
--------------------

Docker's significance lies in its ability to streamline the software development process by providing developers with a more efficient way of setting up their environments. Its strengths include simplicity, ease of use, and the fact that it can be easily extended using existing open-source tools. Moreover, Docker provides isolation for processes and resources through Linux namespaces and cgroups, ensuring each container runs in its own private namespace within the host system, preventing interference with other running containers or systems.

However, one weakness is that while Docker is highly portable across various environments, it may not offer the same level of isolation as some other container technologies like Singularity. This means that users must weigh the benefits and trade-offs based on their specific use case when considering whether to adopt Docker for their software development processes.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
1. Debate Topic: "Is Docker more portable or isolating?"
Statement: "Docker provides a highly portable environment for developers, but may not offer the same level of isolation as other container technologies like Singularity."
2. What If Scenario Question: In a hypothetical scenario where your organization is considering using either Docker or Singularity for a project, you need to decide which one would be better suited for this particular project based on its portability and isolating capabilities. How do you weigh the advantages of each technology in order to make an informed decision?

## Teaching Module: Singularity
1. The Story (Problem  -> Solution  -> Impact)

---

In the early days of high performance computing (HPC), scientists and researchers faced a significant challenge - how to ensure secure and isolated environments for their sensitive workloads without sacrificing performance. They needed an effective solution that could run applications across various HPC environments, including Linux, Windows, or even macOS. This problem was exacerbated by the increasing complexity in managing these diverse systems and securing data integrity within each environment.

One day, a group of researchers stumbled upon something extraordinary - Singularity! It provided them with an isolated environment that could run applications across different HPC environments while ensuring robust security and performance at the same time. This discovery was like finding the perfect solution to a challenging puzzle.

Now, let's dive deeper into understanding how this innovation can impact our lives in a significant way.

2. Storytelling Hooks:

"In an increasingly interconnected world where data privacy and security are paramount, could making computers dumber (i.e., more secure) actually make them smarter?" This intriguing question will capture the imagination of your students as they explore how Singularity is revolutionizing high performance computing environments by offering a secure and isolated environment for running applications across diverse systems.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

To keep your audience engaged, you may want to pause at various points during the story to encourage questions or discussions on what has been learned so far. For example, ask students if they think Singularity's powerful isolation features could be a potential solution for securing their personal data while using cloud-based applications.

Additionally, provide an analogy that your audience can relate to: imagine each computer is like a cookie jar where you place cookies (applications) in different containers - Windows, Linux, and macOS jars. In the past, transferring cookies from one jar to another was not always easy or safe because they could mix with other jars' contents. Singularity simplifies this process by creating separate, secure "jars" for each operating system within a single container.

### Interactive Activities for Singularity
1. Debate Topic: "Is Singularity’s strong isolation more beneficial than potential performance impact in HPC environments?"
Should we prioritize robust security and data integrity over marginally lower performance?

2. 'What If' Scenario Question: Imagine a research team working on optimizing the efficiency of wind turbines for a renewable energy project. The team has been using Singularity containers to manage their computational needs, but is now considering switching to another container technology due to reported higher performance with that alternative. Using Singularity in this scenario would require making an informed decision based on its strengths and weaknesses, weighing data security against the potential impact on efficiency.

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

Once upon a time in a world of computing, organizations faced challenges managing their diverse workloads and resources efficiently. They found it difficult to allocate system resources like CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth among different applications running on the same host. This led to inefficient resource usage and limited flexibility for scaling up or down based on workload requirements.

One day, a brilliant engineer stumbled upon a solution that would change their world forever - Linux Containers (LXC). It was a way of creating multiple isolated environments within a single kernel using features provided by the Linux operating system itself. Each container had its own processes, filesystems, network, and namespaces, allowing for better resource management and isolation among different applications.

The impact of LXC on the computing world has been immense - it enhanced efficiency in managing diverse workloads, enabled faster application deployment, and facilitated scalability based on workload requirements. With this powerful tool at their disposal, engineers could focus more on building innovative solutions rather than worrying about resource allocation.
