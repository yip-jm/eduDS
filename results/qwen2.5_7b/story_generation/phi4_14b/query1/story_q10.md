## Teaching Module: kubelet
## The Story

### The Problem (Event)
In the bustling digital world of the early 21st century, companies faced significant challenges in managing their applications. With microservices architecture becoming increasingly popular, deploying and maintaining these distributed systems became complex. Each application was split into smaller, independent services running in containers that needed to be orchestrated across multiple servers or nodes. The challenge? Ensuring these containers ran reliably and efficiently on each node, adhering to specified configurations without constant human intervention.

Imagine a massive city where each building (node) houses numerous tenants (containers). Without a dedicated manager for each building, chaos would ensue—tenants wouldn't know when to move in or out, leading to overcrowding or vacancies. Before the advent of a crucial solution, managing these containers was akin to running such an uncoordinated city.
