## Teaching Module: Full Virtualization
## 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

### The Problem (Event)
In a world filled with diverse software applications and operating systems, companies faced a significant challenge: running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine without compromising security or performance. Each application required its own environment to function correctly, but sharing hardware resources between them led to compatibility issues, data breaches, and inefficiencies.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
Enter the concept of Full Virtualization—an ingenious solution that transformed this chaotic landscape. Imagine a virtual machine as an entirely self-contained world, isolated from the underlying physical hardware, yet capable of running any operating system or application. This magical realm is created through full virtualization, where everything—from processors to storage—is simulated by software known as a hypervisor.

In this setup, a Type 2 Hypervisor acts like a wise conductor sitting atop an existing operating system. It orchestrates the symphony of hardware components, allowing each virtual machine (VM) to believe it's using real hardware. This complete simulation enables VMs to run independently and securely, offering unparalleled flexibility and compatibility.

### The Impact (Meaning)
The impact of full virtualization is profound. By providing a secure and isolated environment for applications, organizations can now run multiple operating systems on the same physical machine without fear of interference or data leakage. This capability enhances both security and efficiency in managing IT resources. However, this magic comes with its own set of trade-offs. The performance overhead from emulating hardware components means that full virtualization might not be as fast as running applications directly on physical hardware.

The significance lies in the balance it offers—complete isolation and compatibility at the cost of some performance. It allows businesses to leverage existing hardware more effectively while ensuring robust security measures, making it an essential tool in modern computing environments.

## 2. Storytelling Hooks

- **Dramatic Question**: "Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?"
  
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of an engineer facing the challenge of running multiple operating systems on limited hardware resources.

## 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**:
