## Teaching Module: Monolithic Architecture
## **1. The Story**

**The Problem (Event)**: In the early days of computing, applications were monolithic beasts. They were tightly coupled, running on a single server, and burdened by immense code. Scalability was a nightmare, and maintenance was a laborious process. Developers longed for a way to build modular, independent services.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter the **Monolithic Architecture**. This traditional design kept everything in one place, making it easy to manage but also incredibly inflexible. Then, the light bulb moment struck! By decoupling services through a **broker**, we could achieve modularity and scalability. Stateless services became the key.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: The shift from monolithic to **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** was revolutionary. By breaking down the tight coupling, SOA enabled independent scaling, easier maintenance, and improved performance. This was particularly crucial for large-scale systems, where individual services could be developed and scaled without affecting the entire application.

## **2. Storytelling Hooks**

* **Dramatic Question**: Was building computers simpler the key to creating more complex and efficient systems?

* **Point of View**: Imagine you're a developer tasked with building a scalable and maintainable application. What challenges would you face?


## **3. Classroom Delivery Tips**

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, starting with the limitations of monolithic architectures before transitioning to the benefits of SOA. 
* **Analogy**: Compare monolithic architectures to a giant, clunky machine where every part is interconnected. SOA is like having a fleet of smaller, modular machines that can be easily assembled and disassembled as needed.

## Teaching Module: Stateless Design
## Storytelling Module: Stateless Design

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Imagine a bustling coffee shop where regulars order their usual drinks without needing to remember their preferences. This seamless experience relies on the barista remembering each customer's order â€“ an implicit state. But what if the barista vanished between orders? The next customer would have to start from scratch, unaware of previous transactions.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Stateless design emerges as the solution. Just like the coffee shop, services designed in this way treat each request as a fresh start. No history or session information is stored between interactions. This ensures that services can handle multiple clients concurrently without relying on previous requests.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Statelessness brings numerous advantages. By eliminating the need to manage state across requests, it simplifies service design, enhances scalability, and promotes fault tolerance. High availability becomes achievable as the system can gracefully handle fluctuations in traffic without relying on prior interactions.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**: Can we achieve the seamless customer experience without remembering individual preferences?

**Point of View**: Let's delve into the mind of an engineer tasked with building a scalable and reliable service.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
