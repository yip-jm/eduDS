## Teaching Module: Microservices
### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

**The Problem:**  
*Imagine you are an engineer at a major tech company tasked with building a complex application that needs to be both highly scalable and quick to deploy new features. However, traditional monolithic architectures seem to be holding you back. They are hard to scale individually, slow to deploy updates, and the entire system's stability is at risk when any part fails.*

**The 'Aha!' Moment:**  
*One day, while researching ways to improve your application's performance and speed of development, you stumble upon the concept of microservices. This "Eureka!" moment hits when you read about companies like Netflix and understand that they decomposed their applications into independent services that can be developed, deployed, scaled independently, and interact with each other using APIs.*

**The Impact:**  
*Implementing microservices changes everything! Now, your application can scale effortlessly to meet growing demands, new features can be added rapidly without affecting the entire system, and you can use the best tool for each job (language, database, etc.). The flexibility and automation brought by microservices significantly reduce deployment times, making you more agile. However, as you dive deeper, you realize managing these many services can become complex due to increased service interactions.*

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
