## Teaching Module: Container-based virtualization
## Storytelling Module: Container-based Virtualization

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Traditional virtualization creates a barrier between applications and hardware, leading to significant performance overhead. This penalty affects application responsiveness and overall system efficiency.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter container-based virtualization. This lightweight approach avoids hardware isolation penalties by running multiple applications in isolated namespaces on the same underlying operating system. By sharing resources with the host machine, containers achieve near-native performance.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: With container-based virtualization, applications enjoy near-native speed and efficiency, making deployments faster and more flexible. This approach is particularly valuable for cloud computing environments where rapid scaling and resource utilization are crucial.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: Can we achieve high performance without sacrificing isolation?
* **Point of View**: Let's explore the journey of an engineer struggling with application performance in a traditional virtualized environment.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, highlighting the limitations of traditional virtualization. Then, seamlessly transition to the solution by explaining the core features of container-based virtualization. 
* **Analogy**: Imagine containers as virtual apartments sharing the same building (host machine) with efficient resource management, unlike traditional virtual machines that each have their own entire building.

### Interactive Activities for Container-based virtualization
## Debate Topic:

**Is container-based virtualization the future of application deployment, despite having no known weaknesses?**

## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine you are tasked with deploying a mission-critical application that needs to respond rapidly to changes in user traffic. How would you leverage the strengths of container-based virtualization while mitigating potential risks associated with its lack of documented weaknesses?**

## Teaching Module: Docker
## Storytelling Module: Docker

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Researchers in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments often struggle to replicate complex simulations and analyses across different machines and clusters. This inconsistency hinders collaboration and scientific progress.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Docker. Inspired by physical containerization, Docker emerged as a solution to package applications with all their dependencies in a consistent "container." This container can run reliably on any machine, regardless of the underlying operating system.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Docker contributes to the development of container-based virtualization, making HPC more portable and collaborative. While not universally applicable across all industries, its influence on portability across HPC environments stands out.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: "Can we create a computing environment that's as consistent as a physical box, but exists entirely in the digital realm?"
* **Point of View**: "Imagine an engineer who can pack up their entire working environment into a box, complete with all the tools and dependencies, and effortlessly move it to any other computer."

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce Docker with real-world scenarios, gradually escalating complexity. Pause after explaining the core concept and ask students to share their reactions.
* **Analogy**: Compare Docker to a physical container like a shipping container. Explain that it isolates the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent execution across different environments.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
## Debate Topic:

**Is Docker's widespread adoption a testament to its universal applicability, or does its specific applicability limit its widespread use in the industry?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a future where all applications are containerized using Docker. How would this impact the role of system administrators in such an environment? Explain your reasoning, considering both the potential benefits and challenges of such a shift.**

## Teaching Module: Singularity
## Teaching Story: The Singularity

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the world of high-performance computing (HPC), portability has always been a challenge. Traditional computing environments are often siloed and optimized for specific hardware configurations, making it difficult to move workloads across different systems. This fragmentation hinders scientific advancements that rely on accessing vast computational power across diverse HPC platforms.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter the Singularity. Inspired by the success of containerization technologies like Docker, researchers at Berkeley developed Singularity as a containerization platform designed for portability across HPC environments. Singularity isolates applications and their dependencies within containers, shielding them from the underlying infrastructure. This enables seamless movement of workloads between different HPC systems without modifications or recompilation.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: By promoting portability across HPC environments, Singularity contributes to the development of container-based virtualization mechanisms. This shift empowers researchers to leverage the collective power of HPC infrastructure without being bound by hardware limitations. While Singularity has immense potential to accelerate scientific progress, its applicability is still limited due to its nascent stage of development.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: Can we create a computing environment where software runs seamlessly across any hardware, regardless of its specifications?
* **Point of View**: Follow the journey of a researcher grappling with the challenges of traditional HPC workflows and discovering the transformative power of Singularity.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept of HPC and its portability challenges before presenting Singularity as a solution. Pause after explaining the 'Aha!' moment to allow students to absorb the significance.
* **Analogy**: Compare Singularity to building Lego blocks that can be easily assembled and disassembled across different platforms.

### Interactive Activities for Singularity
## Debate Topic:

**The Singularity will ultimately benefit humanity more than it threatens it, despite its potential for job displacement and social disruption.**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a future society where technological advancement has rendered physical labor obsolete. How would the concept of the Singularity influence the distribution of wealth and power in this setting? What ethical considerations would arise in this scenario?**
