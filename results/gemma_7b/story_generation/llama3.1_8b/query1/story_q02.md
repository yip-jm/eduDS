## Teaching Module: Full Virtualization
**Story Module: "The Virtual Sanctuary"**

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
In the world of computer science, there was once a major challenge facing IT administrators and engineers. As computers became more interconnected and reliant on shared hardware resources, security breaches and system crashes were becoming increasingly common. It seemed that every time someone tried to access a critical server or database, they risked bringing down the entire network.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a brilliant engineer named Maya stumbled upon an innovative solution while working late one night in her lab. She had been experimenting with virtual machines and realized that by fully simulating all hardware of the underlying device, she could create a virtual sanctuary for each guest operating system. This meant that if something went wrong on one machine, it wouldn't affect the others – they would remain isolated and secure.

Maya's breakthrough involved creating virtual machines that were completely self-contained, with their own virtual hardware and software environments. She had discovered full virtualization. According to her research, this approach fully simulated all hardware of the underlying device by providing a virtual machine, which in turn offered better performance compared to hosted hypervisors. With full virtualization, the guest operating system would be completely isolated from the underlying hardware.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Maya's discovery revolutionized the way IT administrators approached server management and network security. By implementing full virtualization, they could create secure environments for each application or service, ensuring that if one system failed, it wouldn't bring down the entire operation. This approach provided complete isolation and security, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and system failures.

However, Maya's solution wasn't without its challenges. She soon realized that implementing full virtualization came at a cost – both financially and in terms of performance efficiency. The inherent virtualisation cost due to multiple layers of software was significant, making it less practical for applications that required high processing power or low latency.

Despite these trade-offs, Maya's discovery had a profound impact on the field of computer science. Full virtualization offered a new standard for server management and network security, one that prioritized isolation, security, and reliability above all else.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

- **Dramatic Question**: "Could isolating individual computers in a virtual world actually make our entire network safer?"
  
- **Point of View**: This story can be told from the perspective of an IT administrator facing challenges with server management and security, or from Maya's perspective as she discovers full virtualization.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Pause after describing the problem (The Problem) to ask students what they would do in a similar situation. Then, pause again after explaining how Maya discovered full virtualization (The 'Aha!' Moment) to discuss the benefits and challenges of this approach.
  
- **Analogy**: To simplify the concept of full virtualization for your students, consider using an analogy like a "computer hotel." Just as a hotel has private rooms for each guest, full virtualization provides a secure, isolated environment for each operating system within the computer. This analogy can help make the complex idea more relatable and engaging for your learners.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualization
Here are two distinct items:

**1. Debate Topic: "Full Virtualization is Worth the Cost"**

Debaters will argue for or against the statement: "Implementing full virtualization in data centers is justified despite the high costs associated with multiple layers of software."

This debate encourages students to think critically about the trade-offs between security and cost, weighing the benefits of complete isolation and security against the financial implications. They must consider real-world scenarios where these decisions are made and defend their stance.

**2. "What If" Scenario Question:**

"A major e-commerce company is considering implementing full virtualization for its cloud infrastructure to improve security and scalability. However, this move would require a significant investment in additional software layers, resulting in a substantial increase in operational costs. The company's current annual budget for IT infrastructure is $1 million.

If the decision-makers at the company decide to implement full virtualization, what potential benefits or drawbacks might occur? Justify your answer based on the concept of full virtualization and its inherent trade-offs."

This scenario prompts students to apply their understanding of full virtualization by considering a real-world application. They must weigh the pros (improved security, scalability) against the cons (high cost), demonstrating an ability to think critically about complex technological concepts and their practical implications.

Both these items encourage critical thinking, analysis, and decision-making based on the strengths and weaknesses of full virtualization.
