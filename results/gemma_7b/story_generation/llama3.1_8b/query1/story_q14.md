## Teaching Module: DevOps Culture
**The Story**

### The Problem (Event)
In a software company called NovaTech, projects were constantly getting delayed due to the manual processes and siloed teams. Developers would hand over their work to IT Operations, who would then deploy it on servers that often weren't up-to-date or compatible with the new code. This led to errors, downtime, and frustrated customers.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a team lead at NovaTech, Alex, attended a conference where she learned about DevOps Culture. She realized this was exactly what they needed - a culture and mindset that emphasized collaboration between Business, Software Development, and IT Operations. DevOps Culture wasn't just about adopting new tools or processes; it was about changing the way teams worked together, embracing agility and collaboration to deliver software faster and with higher quality.

Alex explained to her team that under a DevOps Culture:

* They would adopt new ways of working and operating models.
* They would learn new skills and incorporate emerging technologies.
* Their focus would shift from individual departments to the entire delivery process, ensuring smooth operation from development through deployment.

### The Impact (Meaning)
The implementation of DevOps Culture at NovaTech was a game-changer. It accelerated software delivery by 40% and significantly improved quality, reducing errors that used to cause costly downtime. While it required a significant cultural shift and organizational change, the benefits were worth it: happier customers, increased customer loyalty, and a more efficient use of resources.

However, implementing DevOps Culture also highlighted some challenges. It demanded continuous learning and adaptation from all team members, which wasn't always easy. There was resistance to adopting new technologies and processes without clear return on investment (ROI). Moreover, this shift emphasized the importance of collaboration over individual goals, which required a change in mindset.

### Dramatic Question
Could your organization become more agile and responsive by embracing DevOps Culture?

### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer who has witnessed or experienced firsthand the challenges of traditional software development processes.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Pause after describing the problem at NovaTech to ask students if they've ever experienced similar delays in their personal projects or seen it happen in other companies. Then, pause again after explaining DevOps Culture and its benefits to discuss how this approach could be applied to various contexts.
  
- **Analogy**: Explain DevOps Culture as a team working together on a complex puzzle where each member has specific pieces but needs to coordinate with others to ensure the final picture is complete, clear, and beautiful.

### Interactive Activities for DevOps Culture
Here are two distinct items tailored to the provided input data:

### Debate Topic: "Embracing DevOps Culture is the Key to Efficient Software Development"

Statement: 
"The benefits of accelerated software delivery and improved quality far outweigh the costs of implementing a new organizational culture and processes."

Strengths in Focus:
- Accelerates software delivery
- Improves quality

Weaknesses in Question:
- Requires organizational change
- Demands cultural shift

Debating this statement encourages critical thinking, as students are forced to weigh the pros against the cons. It also fosters an understanding of how different stakeholders might view the implementation of DevOps culture within a company.

### "What If" Scenario:

**Scenario:** 

A medium-sized IT consulting firm is considering adopting DevOps practices across its projects. The company currently has a large team working on a legacy project that requires significant changes to meet new regulatory requirements. This would involve re-platforming the system and rewriting substantial portions of the code.

**Question:**

If you were in charge of implementing DevOps at this consulting firm, what approach would you take regarding integrating the existing team with the new processes? Would you:

A) Implement DevOps practices immediately across all projects, including the legacy project.
B) Start by introducing incremental changes to the team's workflow on a smaller, newer project to ease integration and learning.
C) Prioritize the legacy project as it requires significant rework anyway, making the transition smoother.

**Justification:**

This scenario forces students to consider the practical application of DevOps culture, weighing its benefits against the potential disruption to existing workflows. It also encourages them to think about how change can be managed effectively within an organization. By choosing their approach and justifying it, students demonstrate a deeper understanding of the trade-offs involved in adopting such practices.

Both these items are designed to encourage critical thinking, application of knowledge, and practical problem-solving skills among students.

## Teaching Module: CI/CD
**Story Module: "The Agile Assembly Line"**

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Meet Emma, a software development manager at an e-commerce company. Her team is struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of customer demands and changes in technology. They're constantly deploying code changes manually, which takes hours or even days. This leads to delayed releases, frustrated customers, and a bloated product lifecycle.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, Emma's team discovered Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). They learned that CI/CD automates the deployment of code changes from development to production, streamlining their workflow. With CI/CD, they can manage the lifecycle of containers with orchestration, integrate with APIs, and lay the foundation for cloud-native applications.

Imagine a factory where cars are manufactured with precision and speed. Just as each part is carefully assembled and checked, CI/CD ensures that every code change is thoroughly tested, validated, and deployed seamlessly. Emma's team was amazed by the efficiency and reliability this brought to their development process.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
With CI/CD in place, Emma's team saw a significant reduction in deployment time â€“ from days to minutes! They could now release new features faster, making them more competitive in the market. This also reduced the risk of errors and bugs, ensuring customer satisfaction. However, they did have to invest in automating various tools and processes, which required some upfront effort.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** "Can a process that makes development faster and more efficient actually slow down innovation?"

**Point of View:** This story is told from the perspective of Emma, a software development manager who has to balance business needs with the demands of rapid technological change.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing:**
	+ Pause after "Emma's team was struggling" to ask students what they would do in her shoes.
	+ Ask students to imagine how CI/CD could improve their own development workflow (after introducing the concept).
- **Analogy:** Use the factory analogy throughout the explanation, and have students draw a simple diagram illustrating the assembly line process. This will help them visualize the concept of CI/CD.

**Classroom Delivery Suggestions:**

1. Begin by asking students about their experiences with manual deployments or workflows they wish were more efficient.
2. Introduce Emma's team challenge and describe the problems they faced (Significance_Detail).
3. Explain the key points of CI/CD, using the factory analogy to illustrate orchestration and integration.
4. Discuss the strengths (increased deployment frequency and reduced risk) and weaknesses (requirement for automation and integration) of implementing CI/CD.
5. Conclude by asking students to reflect on how they can apply CI/CD principles in their own development workflows or projects.

This teaching story aims to engage students by making them empathize with Emma's challenge, understand the value proposition of CI/CD, and consider its application in real-world scenarios.

### Interactive Activities for CI/CD
Here are two distinct items:

**Debate Topic:**

**"Automation is Overrated: We should prioritize manual deployment over automation for our software projects."**

This debate topic pits the strength of reducing risk through CI/CD against the weakness of requiring automation and integration of various tools. Students can argue both sides, weighing the benefits of reduced risk against the complexity and effort required to set up automated pipelines.

**What If Scenario Question:**

**"You are a DevOps engineer at a company that offers e-commerce services. Your team is responsible for deploying a new feature that involves integrating with multiple third-party APIs. The deployment window is tight, but automation of the CI/CD pipeline has not been fully implemented yet. What would you do? Would you proceed with manual deployment or invest time in automating the pipeline to reduce risk and improve future deployments?"**

This scenario forces students to apply the concept of CI/CD and weigh its strengths against its weaknesses. They must consider the trade-offs between immediate deployment and long-term efficiency, justifying their choice based on the potential consequences of each approach.
