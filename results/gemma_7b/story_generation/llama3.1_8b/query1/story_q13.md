## Teaching Module: DevOps Culture
**DevOps Culture Story Module**

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
The IT department of a large tech company was struggling with frequent software updates. Every time they pushed new code to production, something would break. Users were complaining about downtime and errors. The team felt like they were throwing code over the wall without any regard for how it would affect the underlying systems.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a team lead decided to visit the software development team at their office space. He observed the developers working closely with each other, collaborating on code, and testing it in an isolated environment before deploying it. This was different from what he had seen in IT, where teams worked in silos and only came together when something went wrong. The developer explained that they were following a new way of working called DevOps, which emphasized collaboration between business, software development, and IT operations.

DevOps was not just about writing code; it was also about understanding how the system would behave under different conditions. It involved embracing new skills and technologies to make the process more efficient. The team used tools like automation scripts to speed up deployment and reduce errors. They also had continuous feedback loops with the business stakeholders to ensure that their needs were being met.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The IT department was amazed by the improvements they saw when they adopted DevOps practices. Software delivery became faster, and quality improved significantly. Users no longer experienced downtime or errors during updates. However, it wasn't all smooth sailing. Implementing DevOps required a cultural shift within the organization, which meant that people had to be willing to adapt and change their ways of working.

**Dramatic Question:** Can we break down silos between teams and create a culture that prioritizes collaboration and continuous improvement?

**Point of View:** From the perspective of an IT manager trying to navigate the challenges of implementing DevOps in a large organization.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question:** "Can we break down silos between teams and create a culture that prioritizes collaboration and continuous improvement?"
* **Point of View:** "From the perspective of an IT manager trying to navigate the challenges of implementing DevOps in a large organization."

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing:**
	+ Pause after describing the problem (The Problem) to ask students what they would do if they were in the shoes of the IT department.
	+ After introducing DevOps, pause for a moment to let the concept sink in and ask students to share any experiences where collaboration or automation helped improve a process.
* **Analogy:** "Imagine building a house. Traditional IT is like hiring separate contractors for each room without consulting with them about the overall design. DevOps is like working closely with an architect, builder, and interior designer from the start to ensure that every detail fits together seamlessly."

**Teaching Tips:**

* Emphasize that DevOps is not just a set of tools or practices but a culture shift.
* Discuss how it requires continuous learning and improvement.
* Encourage students to think about real-world applications where collaboration can lead to better outcomes.

By presenting the concept of DevOps through a relatable story, you'll engage your students in understanding its significance and importance for smooth software delivery.

### Interactive Activities for DevOps Culture
Here are two distinct items for the Educational Activity Designer:

**1. Debate Topic:**

**Title:** "Is a DevOps Culture Worth the Cultural Shift?"

**Debatable Statement:** "Embracing a DevOps culture is more beneficial than implementing traditional software development methodologies, despite requiring significant cultural and organizational changes."

**Objective:** Encourage students to think critically about the trade-offs between the strengths (accelerated software delivery and improved quality) and weaknesses (cultural shift and organizational changes) of adopting a DevOps culture.

**Instructions:**

* Divide students into two teams: Pro-DevOps and Anti-DevOps.
* Provide each team with arguments from both sides, including:
	+ Strengths:
		- Accelerates software delivery
		- Improves quality
	+ Weaknesses:
		- Requires cultural shift
		- Organizational changes are challenging to implement
* Have the teams prepare arguments for or against adopting a DevOps culture.
* During the debate, encourage students to focus on the trade-offs and discuss how the benefits of accelerated software delivery and improved quality can be weighed against the challenges of implementing a new culture.

**2. What If Scenario Question:**

**Title:** "The New Software Project"

**Scenario:** A company is launching a new e-commerce platform that requires integrating multiple microservices. The development team consists of 10 developers, with varying levels of experience and expertise. However, none of them have worked together before on such a large-scale project.

**Question:** If you were the project lead, would you adopt a DevOps culture for this project, considering its strengths (accelerated software delivery and improved quality) and weaknesses (cultural shift and organizational changes)? Justify your decision based on your understanding of the trade-offs involved.

**Objective:** Challenge students to apply their knowledge of DevOps culture to a hypothetical scenario and think critically about the potential outcomes. Encourage them to weigh the benefits against the challenges and make an informed decision.

**Instructions:**

* Provide students with the scenario and question.
* Allow them time to read, analyze, and think critically about the trade-offs involved.
* Once they have made their decision (to adopt or not to adopt a DevOps culture), ask them to justify their choice by discussing:
	+ The strengths that led them to this conclusion
	+ The weaknesses that concerned them
	+ Alternative solutions or compromises they considered

This activity will help students develop critical thinking skills, evaluate trade-offs, and apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios.

## Teaching Module: CI/CD Workflows
**The Story**

### The Problem (Event)

Once upon a time, in a busy software development team, they were struggling with delivering quality code to production on time. Bugs kept creeping in at the last minute, causing delays and frustration among team members. They would often spend hours debugging issues that could have been caught earlier in the process.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)

One day, a team lead discovered CI/CD Workflows, which revolutionized their development process. This workflow automates testing and deployment from development to production, ensuring that code is thoroughly tested before being released. It not only included automated testing but also continuous delivery, releasing software updates frequently. The introduction of this workflow created an efficient feedback loop, catching errors early on and reducing the risk of last-minute issues.

### The Impact (Meaning)

The implementation of CI/CD Workflows had a profound impact on their team's efficiency and product quality. It streamlined their development process by automating tasks that were previously manual and time-consuming. This led to fewer deployment errors, improved software quality, and faster delivery times. However, this new approach required significant investment in automation tools and infrastructure setup, highlighting the trade-off between increased efficiency and initial costs.

**Storytelling Hooks**

### Dramatic Question
"Can making our development process more predictable actually make it smarter?"

### Point of View
"From the perspective of a software engineer who has seen her team's productivity and quality improve dramatically with CI/CD Workflows."

**Classroom Delivery Tips**

### Pacing

- Pause after "struggling with delivering quality code to production on time" to ask students if they have ever faced similar challenges.
- After explaining how CI/CD Workflows work, pause again to let the concept sink in. Ask students what changes they think this process would bring to their current workflows.

### Analogy
"Imagine your development team is a busy restaurant kitchen. Just as a well-executed kitchen workflow ensures that orders are prepared correctly and on time, a CI/CD Workflow streamlines software delivery, catching errors early and serving high-quality code to customers."

**Additional Tips**

- Use diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate the process of CI/CD Workflows.
- Discuss how this concept has become crucial in modern software development and its benefits extend beyond just efficiency to product quality.

### Interactive Activities for CI/CD Workflows
**Debate Topic:**

"Title:** 'Automation Overhead vs. Development Efficiency'

Debatable Statement: "While CI/CD Workflows significantly streamline development processes and reduce deployment errors, the upfront investment in automation tools and infrastructure setup is often too great a cost to bear."

This debate topic pits two valid perspectives against each other, forcing participants to weigh the benefits of efficient development against the initial costs and complexities involved. Students will need to analyze both sides carefully before taking a stance.

**What If Scenario Question:**

"Title:** 'Small Shop vs. Large Enterprise'

You are the IT manager at a small startup with limited resources. You have just 3 months to launch your product, but you know that implementing CI/CD workflows would require significant investment in automation tools and infrastructure setup – something you're not sure you can afford.

However, one of your colleagues has developed a proof-of-concept using manual processes, which seems to work well for now. However, the colleague is about to leave the company, leaving you with no clear plan for maintaining the current process or scaling up in the future.

What would you do? Would you prioritize implementing CI/CD workflows despite the initial costs and potential complexities, or would you stick with the manual processes that are working 'good enough' for now?"

This scenario forces students to apply their understanding of CI/CD workflows to a real-world problem. They must weigh the long-term benefits against short-term constraints, considering factors like resource availability, scalability, and risk management. The question is designed to stimulate discussion on the trade-offs involved in adopting this technology.
