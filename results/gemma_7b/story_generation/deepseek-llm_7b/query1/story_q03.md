## Teaching Module: Container-based virtualization
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

In the early days of virtualization, IT engineers faced a problem: traditional hypervisor-based virtualization solutions often led to performance penalties due to hardware isolation and other overheads. They needed an efficient solution that would allow their virtual machines to run smoothly without compromising on speed or efficiency. One day, they discovered container-based virtualization - an innovative approach which aimed at overcoming these challenges.

Container-based virtualization is a lightweight version of hypervisor-based virtualization that shares resources with the host machine while achieving nearly native performance. It addresses the challenge by avoiding hardware isolation penalties and utilizing near-native performance. This discovery led to a significant impact on the way virtual machines are managed, allowing for easier scalability and quicker deployment times.

After explaining this feature, ask your students what makes this solution special compared to traditional application deployment methods in high-performance computing environments.

**Analogy**: Imagine you have a box filled with all the necessary tools and materials for building a house - everything from nails to paint. This is similar to how Docker works; it includes everything an application needs to run, ensuring compatibility between dependencies and preventing issues that might arise when working in different computing environments.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
1. Debate Topic: "Should Docker be Mandatory for All Software Engineers?"
Statement: Docker offers great flexibility in containerization of applications but has limited specific applicability within industries outside of software development, making it not necessary for all software engineers to master the technology.
2. What If Scenario Question: Imagine that you are a developer working on an IoT project with tight deadlines and budget constraints. Your team is given two choices - either learn Docker or use traditional deployment methods. The choice must be made considering that Docker might offer better performance, but may also increase development time due to learning curve and potential compatibility issues. Decide which method would best suit your project's needs while balancing its trade-offs.

## Teaching Module: Singularity
1. The Story (Problem  -> Solution  -> Impact)
------------------------

In the early days of high performance computing (HPC), researchers and engineers faced significant challenges when it came to portability across different environments. They were often forced to use specific hardware or software that was optimized for a particular system, making it difficult to share code and data between projects or institutions. This limitation became especially apparent as research teams began collaborating on increasingly complex simulations and analyses.

One day, while working on a project in the lab, one of our researchers stumbled upon an exciting discovery: Singularity! It was designed to solve the portability issue by creating lightweight containers that could be easily moved between HPC environments. These containers, or "Singletons," were isolated from each other and their underlying system, ensuring that they ran as if they were on a dedicated machine.

The impact of this discovery was immense. Suddenly, researchers no longer had to worry about the specific hardware or software requirements for different projects. They could develop and run code across multiple institutions without any issues. This led to an explosion of collaboration, as teams from all over the world shared their knowledge and expertise through Singularity.

2. Storytelling Hooks
-------------------

* "What if we could create portable containers that could revolutionize high performance computing?"
* From the perspective of a research scientist working on a complex simulation, Singularity allowed them to share code and data across different institutions with ease, leading to more collaboration and breakthrough discoveries.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips
-------------------------

* Pacing: When discussing the problem of portability in HPC environments, take a moment to emphasize how frustrating it was for researchers who needed to use specific hardware or software optimized for a particular system. After introducing Singularity as the solution, pause to allow students to appreciate its impact on collaboration and innovation.
* Analogy: Imagine that each high performance computing environment is like a kitchen with different appliances (e.g., specific hardware, software). Singularity would be like having portable containers that can handle any appliance in any kitchen, allowing you to cook the same meal without worrying about which equipment it was made for.

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)
-------------------------

In the world of computer science and system administration, we often find ourselves dealing with complex systems that need to be managed in various ways. These can include managing different software environments, ensuring security, or even setting up multiple users and their resources on a single machine. But there's one problem that has been plaguing us for years: the difficulty of separating processes from each other while maintaining efficiency.

The process isolation issue became more evident when virtualization technologies like VMware and VirtualBox started to become popular, but they had limitations in terms of performance or resource consumption. It seemed as if we were stuck with this problem until a new solution emerged - Linux Containers (LXC).

One day, while working on a complex system, I stumbled upon LXC after reading about how it could potentially solve the process isolation issue. The more I researched and experimented with it, the more I realized that it offered an incredibly powerful way to manage processes without compromising performance or resource consumption. 

2. Storytelling Hooks

* Pacing: When explaining LXC, start by introducing what it is and how it works using simple language that even beginners can understand. Discuss its impact on performance and resource consumption before diving into more complex aspects like namespaces and file systems.
* Analogy: Imagine each process running in an individual "container" where they have their own isolated environment, much like a series of tiny rooms within one large house - this allows processes to coexist without interfering with each other.

### Interactive Activities for Linux Containers (LXC)
1. Debate Topic: "Should Limited Industry Applicability be Considered a Weakness for Linux Containers?"

Statement: The use of Linux containers (LXC) has clear advantages in terms of resource efficiency, security, and ease of management; however, the limited industry applicability may hinder their widespread adoption. In this debate topic, we will discuss whether or not limited industry applicability should be considered a weakness for Linux Containers.

Strengths: 
- Resource Efficiency - LXC allows multiple applications to share resources efficiently without affecting each other's performance and stability. This can lead to significant cost savings in terms of system hardware acquisition and maintenance.
- Security - With LXC, every container runs as an isolated process on the host operating system with its own set of libraries and processes, providing a level of isolation that is not possible with traditional virtualization technologies like Virtual Machines (VMs). This can significantly reduce security risks related to unauthorized access or malicious attacks.
- Ease of Management - LXC makes it easy to create, destroy, manage, and scale containers as needed without the complexity involved in managing virtual machines.

Weaknesses: 
- Limited Industry Applicability - While Linux Containers are popular among developers, hobbyists, and certain industries (e.g., cybersecurity), their limited industry applicability means that they may not be suitable for all businesses or applications where performance, scalability, and ease of use might be more critical than isolation and security benefits.
- Limited Hardware Support - LXC requires a kernel with support for cgroups and Linux namespaces to function correctly, which is not available on all operating systems like Windows. This limitation could make it difficult for some organizations to deploy containers in their existing IT infrastructure.

2. What If Scenario Question: "If you were the CIO of an e-commerce company that relies heavily on real-time analytics and customer service interactions, should you invest time and resources into learning about Linux Containers? Justify your choice based on this concept's strengths and weaknesses."
