## Teaching Module: Full Virtualization
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

**The Problem (Event):** Companies and organizations had sensitive data stored on their servers that needed strict security measures. However, traditional hardware solutions were often insufficient due to vulnerabilities such as malware or attacks from unauthorized users. They desperately sought a solution for the isolation of resources without incurring high costs.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):** One day, while tinkering with his computer, an engineer discovered that he could create separate virtual machines running different operating systems on the same hardware. This meant multiple instances of applications and data could be isolated from each other, making it difficult for a malware or attacker to compromise one system without affecting others.

**The Impact (Meaning):** Full virtualization offered organizations isolation and security by completely isolating the guest operating system from the underlying hardware. It enabled them to run different software on one physical machine while maintaining performance levels comparable to traditional systems. However, its high inherent virtualisation cost due to multiple layers of software posed challenges in adoption.

2. Storytelling Hooks:
- Dramatic Question: Can virtualization truly revolutionize data security and resource management?
- Point of View: From the perspective of an IT administrator who seeks efficient, secure ways to manage their organization's resources.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

**Pacing**: Pause after sharing the 'Aha!' Moment to allow students to grasp the concept. Then proceed with the Impact section.

**Analogy**: Imagine each virtual machine as a separate room in an apartment building, where occupants can enjoy privacy while still living under one roof.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualization
1. Debate Topic: "Is Full Virtualization Worth the Increased Security Risks?"
Statement: The implementation of full virtualization in an organization provides complete isolation between various IT environments while also increasing security risks due to multiple layers of software, leading to higher costs and potential vulnerabilities. 
Strengths: Complete isolation, increased security
Weaknesses: High inherent virtualisation cost, potential security risks
2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine your school is using full virtualization for its various IT environments like servers, network infrastructure, and applications. The school has recently experienced a data breach due to ransomware attacks. As the information technology director of the school, you have been tasked with deciding whether to continue with full virtualization or switch to a more cost-effective alternative that provides similar security benefits."
Answer: Decide based on your understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of full virtualization and its potential impact on your school's data protection measures. Discuss with stakeholders and make an informed decision, taking into account costs, ease of implementation, and overall effectiveness in securing sensitive information within the organization.

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualization
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

The Problem (Event): Imagine you're building a powerful computer system that needs to run several complex applications simultaneously. You notice that your CPU is getting overwhelmed with managing multiple virtual machines, and performance is starting to suffer.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Enter para-virtualization - an innovative solution that helps optimize the way our machine runs these apps. Para-virtualization involves modifying the guest operating system so it can use hooks for improved simulation of machine execution. Essentially, it allows each virtualized process to run in a dedicated space, allowing your computer's performance to improve and enabling better multitasking abilities.

The Impact (Meaning): The significance of para-virtualization is that it enhances the performance we experience on our computers when dealing with multiple processes or applications. By reducing the overhead of virtualization, this concept allows us to get more done in less time while maintaining stable system resources. However, there are some trade-offs - one being the need for guest OS modification which might be a challenge for certain environments.

2. Storytelling Hooks:

Dramatic Question: Can improving computer multitasking capabilities truly make our lives easier?
Point of View: From the perspective of an engineer looking to optimize their system's performance and efficiency.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

Pacing: When discussing para-virtualization, take your time to explain how it works while also providing examples for better understanding. Pace yourself so you don't overwhelm students with too much technical jargon at once.
Analogy: Imagine para-virtualization as adding more lanes on a freeway - each lane can carry multiple cars (processes or applications) without causing traffic jams (performance issues).

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualization
1. Debate Topic:
"Is Para-Virtualization better for improving performance compared to full virtualization at the cost of requiring guest OS modification?"

Statement: Although para-virtualized guests can offer improved performance, it is not as flexible and requires modifications in guest operating systems. Discuss whether these trade-offs justify using para-virtualization over its counterpart, full virtualization.

Strengths Sides:
  a) Better performance due to reduced resource usage by the host system.
  b) Faster execution of tasks for better user experience.
Weaknesses Side:
  a) Modification required in guest operating systems.
  b) Limited flexibility compared to full virtualization.
2. What If Scenario Question:
"A school is using para-virtualized virtual machines (VMs) for various computing courses, and they have just received an update that allows them to switch between different VM types without modifying the host system." Considering this new feature, would you choose para-virtualization over full virtualization or keep it the same? Justify your choice with trade-offs from both sides.
