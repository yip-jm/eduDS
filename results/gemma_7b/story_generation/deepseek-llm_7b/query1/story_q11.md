## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
1. The Story (Problem – Solution – Impact)

***The Problem (Event):***
Imagine you're an IT manager of a company responsible for managing its cloud infrastructure. You've just learned that it is your responsibility to secure all data stored on your company's servers, even though they are hosted in the cloud. You worry about being able to handle this added security burden while also running and maintaining your business operations efficiently.

***The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):***
One day, you come across a concept called "Shared Responsibility Model" during an online course on Cloud Computing. According to this model, the responsibility for securing cloud infrastructure is shared between three parties: Infrastructure providers, service providers, and users of the cloud services. This means that while it's your job as a user to secure your data by following security best practices and purchasing/leasing security services, the infrastructure provider takes care of ensuring that the underlying hardware, networking equipment, and software are kept up-to-date with security patches, etc.

***The Impact (Meaning):***
This model is crucial for achieving a secure Cloud environment as it ensures that both sides fulfill their obligations in securing cloud infrastructure. It provides clarity on accountability while encouraging proactive measures from all parties involved – providers and users. This shared responsibility helps alleviate the stress of managing security alone, allowing you to focus more on your core business operations.

2. Storytelling Hooks
*Dramatic Question:* "Can a person really be responsible for securing an entire cloud infrastructure?"
*Point of View:* "From the perspective of a user who wants to leverage the benefits of Cloud Computing without worrying about its security implications."

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:
Pacing: After introducing the Shared Responsibility Model, pause and ask the students if they have any questions or concerns before proceeding with further discussion.
Analogy: Imagine you're hiring someone else to cook your dinner for you at a restaurant. You still need to follow basic food safety rules like washing your hands before handling raw ingredients, keeping uncooked meat separate from other foods, and ensuring that leftovers are stored in the refrigerator within two hours after cooking. Similarly, while it might be easier to outsource the responsibility of securing data on cloud infrastructure, users must still adhere to best practices for maintaining secure data access and usage.

### Interactive Activities for Shared Responsibility Model
1. Debate Topic: "Is the Shared Responsibility Model Effective in Ensuring Cybersecurity?"
Statement: The shared responsibility model, by providing clarity on accountability, encourages proactive security measures. However, it may also result in a lack of focus on addressing weaknesses due to a collective effort approach. 

2. What If Scenario Question: In the aftermath of a data breach at a company using the shared responsibility model, explain how this concept's strengths and weaknesses would play out during the incident response process.

## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management
1. The Story (Problem → Solution → Impact)

---

In today's digital age, organizations of all sizes have access to vast amounts of data. This data is critical to their operations and must be protected from unauthorized users or malicious actors who could exploit it for personal gain. However, managing this sensitive information presents a significant challenge that affects both businesses and individuals alike. 

The problem arises when the responsibility of securing data falls primarily on the shoulders of its owners. Without proper identity management and access control measures in place, even authorized users can inadvertently expose their organizations to security risks by granting excessive permissions or leaving sensitive information exposed. This makes it challenging for companies to ensure that only necessary resources are accessible to those who need them.

Enter Identity/Access Management (IAM), a concept designed to resolve this challenge and provide a solution to the problem of securing digital assets while enabling authorized users to access resources efficiently. With IAM, data owners take responsibility for implementing practices such as user provisioning, de-provisioning, and role-based access control. By doing so, they can maintain granular access control over their sensitive information, mitigating security risks effectively.

The impact of Identity/Access Management is profound - it empowers organizations to protect themselves from unauthorized access while ensuring that only authorized users have access to the resources necessary for them to perform their job functions efficiently and securely. With IAM in place, data owners can rest assured that they are taking proactive measures to prevent security breaches and maintain compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA.

2. Storytelling Hooks
- Dramatic Question: "Can you imagine a world where unauthorized users couldn't access your sensitive information?"
- Point of View: "From the perspective of an IT administrator tasked with ensuring data protection."

3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- Pacing: Encourage students to think about their personal experiences and how they manage access to digital resources such as social media accounts or email applications. Ask them if they have ever granted excessive permissions unintentionally, which could lead to potential security risks.
- Analogies: Use analogies like "Imagine each user is a key to an apartment building. With IAM, you can control who has access to what rooms by assigning different keys."

### Interactive Activities for Identity/Access Management
1. Debate Topic: "Should Identity/Access Management be Used as an Exclusive Method for Access Control in Organizations?"
In Favor: I agree with my opponent's viewpoint regarding the importance of identity access management (IAM)

## Teaching Module: Data Protection Responsibilities
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

The Problem (Event): Imagine being in charge of an e-commerce website that handles millions of customer transactions every day. You want to use cloud services to store and process this data securely. However, you're not sure who is responsible for protecting the sensitive information from unauthorized access or breaches.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Data protection responsibilities refer to the accountability for safeguarding data against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. It varies depending on the cloud model – IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service). In an IaaS setup, users are primarily responsible for their own data protection. With PaaS and SaaS providers, they share these responsibilities with the user.

The Impact (Meaning): Understanding data protection responsibilities is crucial in ensuring that sensitive customer information remains secure and confidential while using cloud services like storage or processing. It's essential to know who has control over your data and what measures are being taken to protect it.

2. Storytelling Hooks
- Dramatic Question: "Can you trust the cloud with your customers' personal details?"
- Point of View: From the perspective of a business owner or manager, responsible for protecting sensitive customer information stored on cloud servers.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- Pacing: When discussing data protection responsibilities, take time to emphasize the importance of understanding who is responsible for securing data within each cloud service model (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS).
- Analogy: Imagine you're giving your friend a secret code to access your locker at school. You wouldn't want anyone else using that code without your permission – similar principles apply when it comes to protecting sensitive customer information on the cloud!

### Interactive Activities for Data Protection Responsibilities
1. Debate Topic: "Should Organizations Be Responsible for Their Own Data Protection or Should They Outsource This Responsibility?"
The debate topic can be framed as follows: The strength of having organizations responsible for their own data protection lies in the control it provides over security measures, leading to more effective and tailored solutions. However, this comes at a cost when dealing with multiple providers, which may lead to inefficiencies and confusion regarding responsibility allocation. On the other hand, outsourcing responsibility could result in better expertise and resources from external service providers; however, there is also a risk of losing control over data protection measures due to potential breaches or lack of communication among various parties involved.
2. What If Scenario Question: "If an organization was required by law to keep all sensitive information on-site for easier tracking but faced the challenge of maintaining secure storage in light of recent security incidents, how should they proceed?" 
This scenario can be used as a tool to help students understand the trade-offs associated with data protection responsibilities. They must evaluate whether it's better to maintain control over data by keeping everything on-site or risk possible breaches and losses due to ineffective storage solutions while still complying with legal requirements.
