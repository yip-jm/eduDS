## Teaching Module: Docker
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

In an era of rapid application development and deployment, developers faced challenges in ensuring that their applications ran consistently across different environments. With each new environment came a host of compatibility issues with varying system configurations, creating headaches for both software engineers and IT administrators. This problem was exacerbated by the need to maintain multiple versions of dependencies within these various systems, making it difficult to standardize application distribution while preserving stability.

Enter Docker - an innovative solution that changed the game in application deployment and portability. Through its unique containerization technology, developers can now package their applications with all necessary dependencies into a lightweight, self-sufficient unit called a "Docker image." This means that no matter where or how the application is run, it will function exactly as expected due to the inherent isolation from any underlying host system.

2. Storytelling Hooks

- What if there was a way to make deploying applications across different systems simpler and more predictable? Could making a computer "dumber" actually make it smarter by simplifying deployment challenges? 
- From the perspective of an engineer facing these application deployment challenges, Docker offers a powerful tool that allows for consistency in application behavior regardless of environment.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips

- Pacing: As you introduce the concept, take time to discuss each aspect of containerization and its implications on application deployment. Offer opportunities for students to share their thoughts or ask questions as they process this new information.
- Analogy: Imagine a "Docker image" is like a portable hard drive that contains all your files and settings needed to run an application consistently across different computers, regardless of hardware specifications.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
1. Debate Topic: "Is Docker's lightweight design more important than potential performance issues in a production environment?"

2. What if Scenario Question: Imagine you are running a web application on a server that uses Docker containers. Your boss has asked you to decide between using two different resources for the same workload - one resource has slightly lower CPU usage but higher memory consumption, while the other has similar memory consumption but offers better performance in terms of CPU utilization. Which would you choose and why?

## Teaching Module: Singularity
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

Once upon a time in HPC land, there was a problem with running complex applications and workloads on supercomputers. These high performance computing tasks required massive amounts of resources to run smoothly, but they were often hindered by the limitations of the hardware they ran on. The situation was dire; these powerful machines were unable to achieve their full potential due to these inefficiencies.

Enter Singularity - a containerization tool that promised to solve this problem. It offered parallel execution and advanced resource management features specifically designed for HPC environments, allowing applications to run more efficiently and effectively. This led to an 'a-ha!' moment for many users when they realized the true potential of using Singularity in their workflows.

With Singularity, we could finally unlock the full power of our supercomputers! It allowed us to leverage the resources on these powerful machines without being limited by hardware constraints. The impact was profound - applications that previously struggled were now running smoothly and efficiently, giving us a newfound ability to tackle some of the world's most complex problems.

"Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?" This question begs an answer as we explore how Singularity enables high performance computing tasks on supercomputers by focusing on resource optimization and parallel execution.

From the perspective of an engineer facing these challenges, Singularity offers hope for unlocking the full potential of our powerful machines. It's not about making them 'dumb,' but rather allowing us to utilize their resources more effectively - giving us a new tool in our quest for knowledge and discovery.

* Pacing: When discussing Singularity, it can be helpful to take your time as you explore the various features that make it such an effective containerization solution for HPC environments.
* Analogy: Imagine a busy kitchen where multiple chefs are trying to prepare their dishes at once. Without proper organization and management of resources (like pots, pans, ingredients, etc.), chaos can ensue. Singularity is like having a skilled kitchen manager who ensures that each chef has the necessary tools and space they need while also preventing any conflicts or wastage.

### Interactive Activities for Singularity
1. Debate Topic: "Is the Singularity optimized for HPC workloads more beneficial or detrimental in non-HPC scenarios?"

Justification: This debate topic encourages critical thinking by asking students to consider whether the focus on high performance computing (HPC) is a strength, weakness, or neither when applied outside of that context. Students will have to examine both sides of the argument and articulate their reasoning for why they believe the Singularity's strengths outweigh its weaknesses in non-HPC scenarios, or vice versa.

2. What If Scenario Question: "If the Singularity was optimized for general purpose computing instead of HPC workloads, what potential advancements could we make in fields like artificial intelligence and machine learning?"

Justification: This scenario forces students to think about how a trade-off between optimizing for HPC workloads (as seen with the current Singularity) might affect other areas of computing. By applying their knowledge of AI and ML, students will have to consider which advancements they would prioritize in light of this hypothetical change. They can weigh these decisions against potential consequences or limitations resulting from focusing on general purpose computing instead of HPC. This scenario encourages critical thinking as it pushes students to assess the trade-offs between different focus areas within their field of study.

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

Before Linux Containers were invented, developers struggled with managing and deploying applications in complex environments that required heavy resources like virtual machines (VMs). This made it difficult to maintain efficiency and scalability as they faced resource constraints when running multiple VMs simultaneously on a single physical server.

One day, while working on an application for a client, the development team discovered Linux Containers, a technology that allows processes isolation in lightweight virtualization. It provided them with process separation without the overhead of traditional virtualization, thus allowing efficient and flexible containerized applications. 

Linux Containers offer significant benefits like low resource consumption, high performance, and improved scalability compared to other containerization tools. However, they also have limitations when it comes to security isolation as compared to other solutions.

2. Storytelling Hooks
- Dramatic Question: "Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?"
- Point of View: From the perspective of an engineer facing resource constraints in managing multiple applications.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* Pacing: Ask students to share their thoughts on the dramatic question before moving forward with the lesson, then provide a brief answer and continue exploring the concept further.
* Analogy: Imagine each container as a tiny bubble that encapsulates an application with its own resources. The host system acts like a larger pool of these bubbles where they can be easily shared without affecting other applications.

### Interactive Activities for Linux Containers
1. Debate Topic: "Should we prioritize low resource consumption in Linux Containers over increased security isolation?"
Justification: This debate topic allows students to discuss the importance of balancing performance with security, highlighting the strengths (low resource consumption and high performance) against weaknesses (limited security isolation). Students will analyze trade-offs between these factors when choosing a containerization tool for different applications.

2. What If Scenario Question: "Your team is developing an app that requires both high performance and strong security. You have been provided with Linux Containers or Docker, but the resources are limited. Which would you choose, and why?"
Justification: This scenario forces students to consider their application's specific needs in terms of resource consumption and security isolation. By analyzing this trade-off through a hypothetical choice, they will learn how to prioritize these factors when selecting containerization tools for different projects.
