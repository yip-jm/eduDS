## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in the land of Cloud Services, there was a great kingdom that faced a daunting challenge. Cybersecurity threats were on the rise, and it seemed like nobody could escape them. People from all walks of life - individuals, businesses, governments, and educational institutions - were all affected. The security of their data and infrastructure became a major concern.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a wise sage visited the kingdom and introduced the concept of the Shared Responsibility Model. According to this model, the responsibility for maintaining security in the Cloud was shared between the infrastructure providers, service providers, and the users themselves. The Cloud responsibility diagram clearly defined these shared responsibilities for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings.

The sage explained that while data was never the responsibility of the providers in all three Cloud offerings, it was up to the users to secure their data by following security best practices and purchasing or leasing additional security services if needed. The users and providers had to work together to ensure a secure Cloud environment.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
This model proved to be crucial for achieving a secure Cloud environment because it ensured that all parties involved were aware of their security responsibilities, thus meeting all the necessary requirements at every level. This collaborative approach encouraged proactive security measures and fostered an environment where everyone was accountable.

Although it might seem like a shared responsibility model could lead to confusion or finger-pointing, in reality, it provided clarity on accountability and made sure that all parties were working together to protect the data and infrastructure. The concept's strengths lay in its ability to encourage collaboration and promote security awareness, while its only weakness was the potential for miscommunication if not explained clearly enough. However, the importance of this model was undeniable, as it significantly contributed to a more secure and reliable Cloud environment for everyone.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question**: What happens when everyone in a kingdom takes responsibility for their security, and how does that lead to a safer digital world?
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of a young app developer who must ensure their application's data is secure while using Cloud Services.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Pause after introducing the problem to let students relate to the challenge, and then pause again after the 'Aha!' moment to allow them to process the new concept.
- **Analogy**: Imagine a neighborhood watch program where everyone has a role in keeping the community safe. Infrastructure providers are like the streetlights that illuminate the area, service providers are like security cameras monitoring the streets, and users are like the people who follow safety tips and report suspicious activities.

### Interactive Activities for Shared Responsibility Model
 1. **Debate Topic**: "While the Shared Responsibility Model provides clarity on accountability and encourages proactive security measures, it may lead to a lack of innovation due to the fear of shared liability. Does the potential benefits of this model outweigh its potential drawbacks?"

2. **What If' Scenario Question**: "Imagine a company adopts the Shared Responsibility Model for their cybersecurity strategy. What if a major data breach occurs, and the company is sued by the affected clients? How would you justify the choice of implementing this model based on its strengths and weaknesses in relation to the outcome?"

## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management
 ## The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

### 1. The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a small tech startup named "SecureTech", there was a significant security breach. Data owned by the company and its clients were compromised, causing massive damage to their reputation and client trust. The CEO, Jane, realized they needed to take responsibility for securing their data.

### 2. The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
Jane learned about a concept called Identity/Access Management (IAM). IAM is the process of managing and controlling access to digital assets and resources. Data owners, like Jane, take responsibility for securing their data by implementing IAM practices. Cloud providers offer security services like identity management and access control, which helped SecureTech in optimizing their configurations with tools like AWS Trusted Advisor.

### 3. The Impact (Meaning)
Implementing IAM improved the data security and compliance at SecureTech by providing granular access control. This meant that only authorized users had access to necessary resources, effectively mitigating security risks. By using IAM, Jane's company not only regained their clients' trust but also strengthened their own internal processes.

## Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question**: "What if a single key could unlock the door to every secret in the digital world?"
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of a cybersecurity analyst tasked with protecting a high-profile organization's data.

## Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Introduce the concept of IAM, then delve into its components and importance. Pause after each section to allow students time for comprehension and questions.
- **Analogy**: Imagine an office where access to different rooms represents different levels of data security. IAM would be like a master key that can only open specific doors based on who holds the key, ensuring the right people have access to the right information.

### Interactive Activities for Identity/Access Management
 1. Debate Topic: "Identity/Access Management systems may be seen as an essential tool for improving data security and compliance; however, critics argue that they can become a burden by overly restricting access to critical information. In this debate, we will explore the pros and cons of implementing Identity/Access Management systems in organizations."

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine you are the IT manager of a large corporation, and your company is considering implementing an Identity/Access Management system. One of your departments, however, argues that this would significantly slow down their workflow due to increased security measures. How would you justify the implementation of Identity/Access Management, considering both the improved data security and compliance benefits and the potential decrease in productivity for certain departments?"
