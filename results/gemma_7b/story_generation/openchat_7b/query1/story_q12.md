## Teaching Module: Data Safeguarding in Different Service Models
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
**The Problem (Event)**: In the bustling city of DataVille, people from different professions had varying needs when it came to storing their valuable information in the cloud. An art gallery needed to store and protect their digital artworks, a hospital wanted to safeguard patient records, and a school district was responsible for students' data. But as they entrusted their data to the providers of Cloud Land, they started worrying about the safety of their information.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: One day, a wise cloud wizard named DataProtector visited DataVille and explained that there are different service models in Cloud Land, each with its own way of safeguarding data. In IaaS, the physical infrastructure was like a castle, keeping data safe behind strong walls owned by the provider. In PaaS, the virtual environment was like a fortress managed by the provider to protect the data from potential threats. And in SaaS, the applications in the cloud were like secret keepers, safeguarding the information within them.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: DataProtector's wisdom brought peace of mind to the citizens of DataVille. They learned that by understanding these service models, they could ensure appropriate protection for their data, regardless of the model used. But they also realized that depending on the model, additional security measures might be necessary.
