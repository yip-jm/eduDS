## Teaching Module: Container-based virtualization
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
**The Problem (Event):** Once upon a time in the mystical land of Techtopia, there was a village called SoftwareVille. The people of this village were using a powerful tool called hypervisor-based virtualization to create and manage multiple software environments on their computers. However, they noticed that it was causing a significant performance overhead, making their computers slower than desired.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):** One day, a clever inventor named Container-Wise discovered a new tool called container-based virtualization. This tool worked differently from the traditional hypervisor-based virtualization. Instead of isolating each software environment in its own separate space, it shared resources with the host machine. This way, it avoided the hardware isolation penalties and achieved near-native performance.

**The Impact (Meaning):** The people of SoftwareVille were amazed by the speed and efficiency of container-based virtualization. They saw that it had lower start-up times compared to traditional virtualization. Even though it shared resources with the host machine, it didn't compromise on security or functionality. This new tool was a game-changer for them, making their computers smarter and faster while keeping them simple and efficient.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question:** "Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?"
- **Point of View:** From the perspective of an engineer facing the challenge of improving the performance of SoftwareVille's computers.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
**Pacing:** Pause after introducing hypervisor-based virtualization and its performance overhead to allow students to process the information. Then, pause again after the introduction of container-based virtualization to emphasize its benefits and differences from the traditional method.

**Analogy:** Imagine a family with many children sharing toys in one room, which is similar to container-based virtualization. Each child can play with any toy without needing their own separate room for each toy, saving space and making everyone's lives easier.

### Interactive Activities for Container-based virtualization
 1. Debate Topic: "Container-based virtualization is more advantageous than traditional virtualization in terms of start-up times, but does this efficiency justify overlooking potential weaknesses?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a situation where a company needs to deploy multiple applications on the same server for their clients. The company's IT team has two options - they can either use container-based virtualization or traditional virtualization. In this scenario, should the IT team opt for container-based virtualization due to its lower start-up times, or would traditional virtualization be a more suitable choice despite having longer start-up times?"

## Teaching Module: Docker
 ## The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
_Problem:_ In the land of computer science, there was once a great challenge. Scientists and engineers were working tirelessly to develop applications that would run on high-performance computing (HPC) environments. However, they faced a significant problem: their applications were not portable across different HPC systems. This made it difficult for them to deploy and manage applications efficiently.

_Aha! Moment:_ One day, a brilliant engineer named Docker stumbled upon a solution that could revolutionize the way applications were deployed and managed. Docker was an innovative containerization platform that simplified the deployment and management of applications by focusing on portability across HPC environments. It provided process, filesystem, namespace, and spatial isolation for applications. This meant that applications could run in isolated environments, without interfering with each other or the underlying system.

_Impact:_ Docker's contributions to container-based virtualization mechanisms were groundbreaking. By emphasizing portability across HPC environments, it allowed engineers and scientists to deploy their applications on different systems without any modifications. This increased efficiency and reduced the time and effort required for application deployment and management. However, it's important to note that Docker's applicability is specific to certain industries, such as those with a focus on HPC environments.

## Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question:** Can one platform unify the way applications are deployed and managed across various high-performance computing environments?
- **Point of View:** From the perspective of an engineer working in a high-performance computing environment.

## Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing:** Pause after introducing the problem to allow students to process the information. Pause again after the 'Aha!' moment to emphasize the significance of Docker's solution. Finally, pause at the end of the story to discuss its impact and trade-offs.
- **Analogy:** Imagine a busy city with different modes of transportation (cars, buses, bicycles) all coexisting peacefully without causing chaos or interference. Docker is like the traffic controller for these different applications, ensuring they run smoothly in their isolated environments within the high-performance computing city.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
 1. Debate Topic: "While Docker significantly simplifies the process of application deployment and management, its specific applicability in the industry may limit its overall utility. Should companies invest time and resources to learn and implement Docker, or should they focus on other, more universally applicable tools?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a situation where a start-up is considering using Docker for their application deployment process. They have two options - Option A: Use Docker to streamline the deployment and management of their applications; Option B: Not use Docker and instead rely on traditional deployment methods. Analyze these options and justify which choice would be more beneficial for the start-up, considering both the strengths and weaknesses of Docker."
