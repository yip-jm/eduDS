    {
      "Concept": "Stateless Design",
      "Definition": "A design approach where services do not maintain internal state information between requests.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Services are designed to process requests independently without relying on past interactions.",
        "Statelessness enhances scalability and resilience by isolating state within individual requests.",
        "Improves performance by reducing overhead associated with state management."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Stateless design simplifies service development and deployment by eliminating the need for complex state synchronization and coordination between services.",
      "Strengths": "Increased scalability, improved performance, and simplified development.",
      "Weaknesses": "Not suitable for applications that require stateful operations."
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Interface Abstraction",
      "Definition": "The process of hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary functionalities through an interface.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Abstraction simplifies interaction by decoupling clients from implementation details.",
        "Clients interact with services through well-defined interfaces that outline expected input and output.",
        "Enhances reusability and maintainability by isolating implementation changes."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Interface abstraction promotes modularity and reusability by allowing clients to interact with services without knowledge of their underlying implementation.",
      "Strengths": "Improved modularity, reusability, and maintainability.",
      "Weaknesses": "May introduce additional overhead due to interface definition and management."
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Brokers",
      "Definition": "Software intermediaries that facilitate service discovery and communication.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Brokers maintain a directory of available services and their metadata.",
        "Clients can query brokers to locate appropriate services based on their requirements.",
        "Simplifies service discovery and composition in distributed environments."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Brokers enable efficient service discovery and composition by centralizing service metadata and facilitating communication between clients and services.",
      "Strengths": "Enhanced service discovery, improved composition, and reduced communication overhead.",
      "Weaknesses": "May become bottlenecks due to increased traffic or complex service discovery scenarios."
