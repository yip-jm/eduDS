  "Core_Concepts": [
    {
      "Concept": "Microservices",
      "Definition": "Small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Microservices are designed to be autonomous and loosely coupled.",
        "They can be scaled independently of each other.",
        "Microservices architecture promotes modularity and reusability."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Microservices enable continuous deployment, rapid innovation, and scalability.",
      "Strengths": "Increased modularity and scalability.",
      "Weaknesses": "Increased communication overhead and distributed complexity."
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Containers",
      "Definition": "Isolated packages of code and dependencies that can run reliably across different environments.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Containers bundle up code, libraries, and dependencies.",
        "They provide isolation from other running processes.",
        "Containers enhance portability and reproducibility."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Containers facilitate consistent application deployment across different environments.",
      "Strengths": "Improved portability and isolation.",
      "Weaknesses": "Limited resource isolation and potential performance overhead."
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Orchestration Layers",
      "Definition": "Software that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Orchestration tools manage multiple containers across multiple hosts.",
        "They provide features like deployment automation, scaling, and health checks.",
        "Popular orchestration tools include Kubernetes and Docker Swarm."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Orchestration layers streamline container management and deployment.",
      "Strengths": "Automated deployment and scaling.",
      "Weaknesses": "Increased complexity and potential single point of failure."
