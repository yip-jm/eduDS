  "Core_Concepts": [
    {
      "Concept": "Shared Responsibility Model",
      "Definition": "A model where security is shared between infrastructure providers, service providers, and users.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "The Cloud responsibility diagram defines the shared responsibility between users and providers for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS offerings.",
        "Data is never the responsibility of providers in all three Cloud offerings.",
        "Users are responsible for securing their data by following security best practices and purchasing/leasing security services."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Shared responsibility is crucial for achieving a secure Cloud environment as it ensures that security requirements are met at all levels.",
      "Strengths": "Provides clarity on accountability and encourages proactive security measures.",
      "Weaknesses": null

      "Concept": "Identity/Access Management",
      "Definition": "The process of managing and controlling access to digital assets and resources.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Data owners take responsibility for securing their data by implementing identity/access management practices.",
        "Cloud providers offer security services like identity management and access control.",
        "Tools like AWS Trusted Advisor can help optimize identity/access management configurations."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Effective identity/access management ensures that only authorized users have access to necessary resources, mitigating security risks.",
      "Strengths": "Improves data security and compliance by granular access control.",

    {
      "Concept": "Data Protection Responsibilities",
      "Definition": "The accountability for protecting data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Data protection responsibilities vary depending on the Cloud model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).",
        "In IaaS, data protection is primarily the responsibility of the user.",
        "PaaS and SaaS providers share data protection responsibilities with users."
