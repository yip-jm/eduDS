    {
      "Concept": "Microservices",
      "Definition": "An architectural style that decomposes a large application into smaller, independent services.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Microservices are independently developed and deployed.",
        "Communicate with well-defined APIs.",
        "Promote modularity and scalability."

      "Strengths": "Increased modularity and scalability.",
      "Weaknesses": "Increased complexity due to distributed architecture."

      "Concept": "Container Technologies",
      "Definition": "Software packages that bundle code and dependencies for consistent execution across different environments.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Containers isolate applications from each other and the underlying operating system.",
        "Promote portability and reproducibility.",

      "Definition": "Software that automates the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Orchestration tools manage multiple containers across multiple hosts.",
        "Provide health checks and automatic restarts.",
        "Offer load balancing and scaling capabilities."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Centralizes management and improves scalability.",
      "Strengths": "Automated deployment and scaling.",
      "Weaknesses": "Increased complexity due to dependency on the orchestration tool."

      "Concept": "CNCF’s Stack Definition",
      "Definition": "A four-layer architecture that defines the infrastructure, provisioning, runtime, and orchestration layers.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Infrastructure layer: Infrastructure as code.",
        "Provisioning layer: Automated resource allocation.",
        "Runtime layer: Container runtime environment.",
        "Orchestration layer: Container orchestration tools."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Provides a reference architecture for cloud-native applications.",
      "Strengths": "Clarity and modularity.",
