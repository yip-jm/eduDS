  "Core_Concepts": [
    {
      "Concept": "Shadow Page Tables",
      "Definition": "A data structure used in virtual memory management to accelerate the mapping of virtual memory pages to physical memory.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Shadow page tables are updated when the guest OS changes the virtual memory to physical memory mapping.",
        "Direct lookup is enabled after shadow page tables are updated.",
        "TLB hardware is used to map virtual memory directly to machine memory."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Shadow page tables reduce the overhead of virtual memory translation by caching page table mappings and enabling direct access to physical memory.",
      "Strengths": "Improved performance by reducing the number of page table lookups.",
      "Weaknesses": "Increased memory consumption due to the additional shadow page table data structure."
    },
    {
      "Concept": "MMU (Memory Management Unit)",
      "Definition": "A hardware component in modern CPUs responsible for translating virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "MMU virtualisation is required to support guest OS memory management.",
        "The guest OS controls the mapping of virtual addresses to guest physical addresses.",
        "The hypervisor maps guest physical memory to the actual machine memory."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "MMU virtualisation allows multiple VMs to share the physical memory of a host system without conflicts.",
      "Strengths": "Efficient memory utilization by isolating virtual memory spaces.",
      "Weaknesses": "Overhead introduced due to the additional layer of translation."
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Device Emulation",
      "Definition": "The process of creating virtual representations of physical devices, such as network cards, to provide them to VMs.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Hypervisors virtualize physical hardware and present VMs with standardized virtual devices.",
        "Virtual devices emulate well-known hardware and translate VM requests to system hardware.",
        "I/O Virtualisation manages the routing of I/O requests between virtual devices and physical hardware."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Device emulation enables VMs to access essential hardware resources without requiring physical access to the underlying hardware.",
      "Strengths": "Isolation of device resources between VMs",
      "Weaknesses": "Increased complexity due to the need for device emulation."
