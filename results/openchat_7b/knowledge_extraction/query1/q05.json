    {
      "Concept": "Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)",

      "Key_Points": [
        "introduced the concept of a new component with the simple role to help locate the appropriate services",
        "services are stateless, for a good reason which is to make the design scalable",

      "Strengths": [
