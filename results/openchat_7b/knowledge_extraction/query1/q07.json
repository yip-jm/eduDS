  "Overall_Summary": "Grid computing is a distributed computing paradigm that focuses on distributing workload across multiple nodes, while Cloud computing provides on-demand, scalable, and elastic resources over the internet. Both Grid and Cloud computing require resource management, but Cloud computing offers a pay-per-use model and has less interoperability between providers compared to Grid systems.",
