  "Core_Concepts": [
    {
      "Concept": "Operating system level virtualisation",
      "Definition": "Uses isolation mechanisms to provide users with virtual environments similar to a dedicated server.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Isolates users in virtual environments similar to a dedicated server.",
        "Requires the guest operating system to be modified to use a set of hooks to improve machine execution simulation."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Operating system level virtualisation is important because it allows multiple users to run their own isolated environments on the same physical hardware, increasing resource utilization and efficiency.",
      "Strengths": "This type of virtualisation can improve security by isolating user environments from each other.",
      "Weaknesses": "The guest operating system needs to be modified, which may introduce compatibility issues."
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Para-virtualization",
      "Definition": "Requires the guest operating system to be modified to use a set of hooks to improve machine execution simulation – Para-virtualisation enabled by Type1 Hypervisor.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Guest operating system is modified to use hooks for improved machine execution simulation.",
        "Enabled by Type1 Hypervisor."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Para-virtualization is important because it allows the guest operating system to be more compatible with the underlying hardware, reducing performance overhead.",
      "Strengths": "This type of virtualisation can improve performance by using hooks for improved machine execution simulation.",
      "Weaknesses": "The guest operating system needs to be modified, which may introduce compatibility issues."
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Full virtualization",
      "Definition": "Fully simulates all the hardware of the underlying device by providing a virtual machine.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Simulates all the hardware of the underlying device.",
        "Provides a virtual machine."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Full virtualization is important because it allows any operating system to run on the virtual machine without modification, providing greater flexibility and compatibility.",
      "Strengths": "This type of virtualisation can support a wide range of guest operating systems without modification.",
      "Weaknesses": "Full virtualization may have higher performance overhead compared to other types of virtualisation."
    }
  ],
  "Overall_Summary": "Virtualization is the process of creating isolated environments on a single physical hardware, allowing multiple users or applications to run simultaneously. Operating system level virtualization, para-virtualization, and full virtualization are different approaches to achieve this goal, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.",
