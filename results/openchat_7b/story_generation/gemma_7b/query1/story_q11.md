## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
## Storytelling Module: Shared Responsibility Model

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the cloud computing world, security has always been a shared responsibility. But who's responsible for what? This ambiguity can leave organizations vulnerable to security threats.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter the Shared Responsibility Model! This model clarifies the division of security responsibilities between two key players: the infrastructure provider and the service provider. The infrastructure provider safeguards the underlying infrastructure, while the service provider protects the services they offer. Users, in turn, take responsibility for securing their data and applications.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: This model fosters trust and accountability. By clearly defining roles and responsibilities, organizations can focus on their core business while benefiting from the expertise of their providers. But it also means that everyone needs to play their part. Understanding and adhering to the Shared Responsibility Model is crucial for achieving a secure cloud environment.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

- **Dramatic Question**: Can we achieve cybersecurity by making computers dumber? (The answer is: by sharing the responsibility!)
- **Point of View**: Let's imagine you're a cloud user. What are your anxieties about security, and how can this model ease them?

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, building on prior knowledge of cloud computing. Pause after explaining each party's responsibility to allow students to digest the information.
- **Analogy**: Compare the Shared Responsibility Model to a restaurant. The infrastructure provider is like the chef who prepares the food (infrastructure), the service provider is like the waiter who serves the food (services), and the user is like the customer who orders and pays for the food (data and applications).

### Interactive Activities for Shared Responsibility Model
## Debate Topic:

**Is the Shared Responsibility Model the ideal solution for achieving optimal security in today's digital landscape?**

## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a situation where a critical piece of infrastructure within the Shared Responsibility Model fails. How can organizations effectively mitigate the risks associated with this failure while still reaping the benefits of shared responsibility?**

## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management
## Storytelling Module: Identity/Access Management

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the bustling cloud computing world, sensitive data floats around like whispers in the wind. But what happens when mischievous squirrels, representing unauthorized users, discover the open doors to this data? Disaster! Data breaches become the costly consequence.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter the realm of Identity/Access Management (IAM). This magical system is like a meticulous gatekeeper, ensuring only authorized users – the trusted insiders – can access the right resources at the right time. It involves creating, managing, and deleting user accounts, while access control serves as the digital lock and key, determining what users can access.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: By implementing IAM, we empower security by preventing unauthorized access to data. This is particularly crucial in the cloud, where data is dispersed across multiple servers like a sprawling library. IAM provides a layer of control and monitoring over who can access what, mitigating the risk of security breaches and ensuring data integrity.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: Can we create a system where only the right people can access the right things at the right time?
* **Point of View**: Let's explore the journey of a cloud architect tasked with building a secure and efficient data management infrastructure.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, building up to the 'Aha!' moment. Pause to allow students to grasp the significance of each element.
* **Analogy**: Compare IAM to a school library. Users are students who need access to different books (resources), while librarians (gatekeepers) control who can access what and when.

### Interactive Activities for Identity/Access Management
## Debate Topic:

**Is the implementation of robust identity/access management more important for securing digital resources than addressing the human vulnerabilities that exist within an organization?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**You are tasked with securing a new, highly sensitive data set. There are two options available: implement a cutting-edge access control system that costs $1 million, or implement a less expensive system with known vulnerabilities but can be easily managed by your team. Which option would you choose and why?**

## Teaching Module: Data Protection Responsibilities in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
## 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Data breaches in the cloud were becoming increasingly common, raising concerns about the security of sensitive information stored in various cloud service models.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: During a brainstorming session, an engineer realized that understanding the specific data protection responsibilities for each cloud service model was crucial for mitigating these risks. This led to the discovery of the concept of 'Data Protection Responsibilities in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS'.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: By clarifying these responsibilities, users can choose the appropriate level of security for their needs. However, it's important to note that misunderstandings can lead to security vulnerabilities. Data protection requires a collaborative effort between users and service providers in the cloud environment.


## 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**: Can we achieve better data security by sharing some of the responsibility for security with the cloud service provider?

**Point of View**: Let's explore this concept from the perspective of a data security officer tasked with safeguarding sensitive data in the cloud.


## 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, starting with a real-world example of a data breach in the cloud. Then, explain the different cloud service models and their associated data protection responsibilities. Finally, discuss the importance of understanding these responsibilities for effective data security.

**Analogy**: Compare the relationship between users and cloud service providers to that of a tenant and a landlord. The tenant (user) is responsible for securing their belongings (data), while the landlord (service provider) is responsible for securing the building (infrastructure).

### Interactive Activities for Data Protection Responsibilities in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
## Debate Topic:

**Is the ability to tailor security levels a sufficient safeguard to mitigate the risks associated with data protection responsibilities in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS models?**

## What If Scenario Question:

**You are tasked with designing a data storage solution for a startup that deals with highly sensitive personal data. The solution needs to balance the need for security with the desire for accessibility and ease of use. How would you approach this challenge, considering the strengths and weaknesses of different IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS models in terms of data protection responsibilities? Justify your recommendations based on the specific trade-offs involved.**
