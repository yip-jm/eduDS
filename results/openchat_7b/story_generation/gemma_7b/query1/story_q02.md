## Teaching Module: Operating system level virtualisation
## Storytelling Module: Operating System Level Virtualisation

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In a shared computing environment, users often need isolated environments to run their own applications and data. Traditional approaches like physical servers are expensive and resource-intensive.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter operating system level virtualisation! By isolating users in virtual environments resembling dedicated servers, this technology allows multiple users to run their own operating systems on the same physical hardware. The guest operating system requires modifications to interact with the virtualisation layer through hooks, enabling efficient machine execution simulation.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Operating system level virtualisation enhances resource utilization and security. By isolating users from each other, it reduces the risk of conflicts and data breaches. This approach is vital for maximizing efficiency in shared computing environments.


### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**: Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter by offering more efficient resource sharing and isolation?

**Point of View**: Let's explore this concept from the perspective of an engineer tasked with building a collaborative computing platform for multiple users.


### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, explaining the challenges of shared computing environments before transitioning to the solution. Pause after describing the 'Aha!' moment to allow students to absorb the idea.

**Analogy**: Imagine a bustling city with limited parking spaces. Virtualisation is like building separate virtual parking lots where each user can park their car (operating system) independently, maximizing space utilization and reducing congestion.

### Interactive Activities for Operating system level virtualisation
## Debate Topic:

**Is the security advantage of operating system level virtualisation worth the potential compatibility issues it introduces?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a world where operating system level virtualisation is used for all user environments. How would this impact the development and deployment of new software applications? What challenges might arise in such a scenario?**

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualization
## Teaching Story: Para-virtualization

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Developers building virtual machines often encounter performance bottlenecks due to the gap between virtual and physical hardware. This gap limits the potential of applications running inside the virtual machines.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter para-virtualization! This innovative technique enables interaction between the guest operating system and the underlying hardware through hooks. By exploiting these hooks, para-virtualization improves the efficiency of machine execution simulation, boosting performance.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Para-virtualization bridges the gap between the virtual and physical worlds, making virtual machines feel more like real machines. This crucial optimization is especially valuable for resource-intensive applications running inside virtual environments. While para-virtualization can significantly enhance performance, it comes with a trade-off: the guest operating system needs to be modified, potentially impacting compatibility.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: "Can we make a virtual computer think it's a real one, without adding extra processing power?"
* **Point of View**: "Imagine you're an engineer tasked with building a virtual world that feels indistinguishable from reality for users."

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, focusing on the performance challenges of virtual machines. Then, present para-virtualization as the solution and explain its working. Finally, discuss the trade-offs associated with this technique.
* **Analogy**: Compare para-virtualization to a skilled musician who can optimize their instrument's performance by interacting directly with its hardware components.

### Interactive Activities for Para-virtualization
## Debate Topic:

**Is para-virtualization a viable performance optimization technique despite the need for guest OS modification?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a situation where a company needs to migrate a legacy application to a cloud environment. The application relies heavily on hardware-specific drivers that are not readily available in the cloud. How can para-virtualization be used to address this challenge while mitigating potential compatibility issues?**

## Teaching Module: Full virtualization
## Teaching Story: Full Virtualization

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the digital age, compatibility between operating systems became a nightmare. Different platforms ran different software, leading to compatibility issues and headaches for engineers.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter full virtualization. This innovative technology simulates all the hardware of the underlying device, creating a virtual machine. Now, any operating system could run on this virtual machine without modification.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: The power of full virtualization lies in its flexibility. By eliminating the need for OS modification, it fosters greater compatibility and empowers engineers to seamlessly work across different platforms. While this approach offers a wider range of supported guest operating systems, it may incur performance overhead due to the additional layer of virtualization.


### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?
* **Point of View**: Imagine you're a digital architect tasked with building a system that can seamlessly run any software, regardless of the underlying hardware.


### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, building from the problem to the solution. Pause after the 'Aha!' moment to allow students to grasp the significance.
* **Analogy**: Compare full virtualization to building a sandbox for your computer. The sandbox (virtual machine) allows you to experiment with different tools (operating systems) without affecting the underlying system (hardware).

### Interactive Activities for Full virtualization
## Debate Topic:

**Is full virtualization the ideal approach for virtualisation in contemporary computing environments, considering the trade-off between its wide operating system compatibility and potential performance overhead?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine you are tasked with creating a virtual environment for a new application that requires high performance. Would you prioritize compatibility with a wide range of operating systems or prioritize performance optimization in your virtualisation strategy? Explain your reasoning based on the strengths and weaknesses of full virtualization.**
