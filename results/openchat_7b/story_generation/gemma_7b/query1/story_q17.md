## Teaching Module: Cloud-Native
## **1. The Story**

**The Problem (Event)**: Netflix, Twitter, and other giants were facing a common dilemma – their infrastructure was rigid, unable to keep pace with their rapidly evolving needs. Continuous deployments were cumbersome, scaling was laborious, and innovation was stifled by complex dependencies.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Inspired by the cloud-native strategies of companies like Netflix and Uber, engineers realized the answer lay in an amalgamation of best practices. This 'Cloud-Native' approach embraced continuous deployment, containerization, and microservices to achieve elastic scaling, rapid innovation, and increased automation.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Cloud-Native fosters a sustainable ecosystem where developers can collaborate seamlessly and share high-quality projects built around containerized microservices. This empowers the community to build and scale applications efficiently, fostering continuous innovation and competitiveness.


## **2. Storytelling Hooks**

* **Dramatic Question**: Can we make computing simpler to achieve greater efficiency and innovation?
* **Point of View**: Let's explore the journey of a startup using Cloud-Native to scale their platform from a small team to a global phenomenon.


## **3. Classroom Delivery Tips**

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, then delve into specific practices like continuous deployment and microservices. Ask questions after each section to ensure understanding.
* **Analogy**: Compare Cloud-Native to a symphony orchestra where each instrument (microservice) plays independently but together creates a harmonious melody (application).

### Interactive Activities for Cloud-Native
## Debate Topic:

**Is the growth of the Cloud-Native ecosystem a greater benefit than the potential risks associated with its reliance on open source technologies and collaborative environments?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a scenario where Cloud-Native technology becomes mandatory for all educational institutions globally. How would this impact the relationship between accessibility, security, and innovation in online learning environments?**

## Teaching Module: CNCF
## Storytelling Module: CNCF

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Developers were struggling to manage complex applications composed of numerous microservices, which often relied on different infrastructure configurations and deployment models. This patchwork approach led to challenges in scaling, reliability, and collaboration.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)! Inspired by the success of containerization, CNCF recognized the need for a unified approach to building and managing cloud-native applications. They developed a reference architecture outlining four layers: infrastructure, provisioning, runtime, and orchestration. This hierarchical structure simplifies deployment, enhances collaboration, and facilitates efficient management of microservices.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: CNCF empowers developers by fostering an open-source ecosystem around high-quality projects aligned with their reference architecture. This collaborative approach accelerates innovation, promotes technological advancements, and ensures sustainable growth within the cloud-native landscape.


### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: "Can we simplify cloud-native development without sacrificing complexity?"
* **Point of View**: "Imagine being a developer juggling multiple microservices – how can you maintain control and efficiency?"


### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, highlighting the challenges before presenting CNCF as the solution. Allocate sufficient time for discussing the four layers and their functionalities.
* **Analogy**: Compare CNCF to a symphony orchestra. Each layer plays a distinct role, working together to create harmony and coherence in the cloud-native ecosystem.

### Interactive Activities for CNCF
## Debate Topic:

**Is the promotion of CNCF detrimental to individual innovation due to its emphasis on collaboration and open-source projects?**

## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a future where CNCF technology becomes widespread, affecting both developed and developing economies. How might this technology balance the need for economic growth with environmental sustainability in such a scenario?**
