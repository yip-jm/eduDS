## Teaching Module: Operating system level virtualisation
### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine a school with only five computers, but twenty students who need them for their projects. Each student needs a dedicated computer to run their operating system and software without interfering with others. However, allocating each student their own physical machine is impractical due to costs, space constraints, and the limited number of devices available.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, an IT engineer at the school discovered a brilliant solution – operating system level virtualisation. This concept uses isolation mechanisms to provide users with virtual environments similar to dedicated servers. Each user can run their own isolated environment without affecting others, just like having their own physical machine. The guest operating system is modified to use hooks that improve machine execution simulation.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Operating system level virtualisation matters because it allows for efficient and secure sharing of resources among multiple users on the same hardware. With this technology, each student can now have a dedicated virtual environment without needing a physical computer. This approach not only saves costs but also increases resource utilization. However, implementing OS-level virtualisation requires modifying the guest operating system, which may introduce compatibility issues.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
"Could sharing a single computer among many students actually make learning more efficient and secure?"

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an IT manager trying to optimize school resources while ensuring student productivity and security.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing
- Pause after "Imagine a school with only five computers, but twenty students..." to ask if students have ever experienced resource constraints.
- Ask a question about how students would solve this problem without the concept of virtualisation.
- After explaining OS-level virtualisation, pause again to discuss its implications and challenges.

#### Analogy
"Think of operating system level virtualisation like renting separate rooms in a large house. Each student has their own 'room' (virtual environment) without affecting others, just as you wouldn't disturb your roommates in different apartments."

**Classroom Delivery Tips:**

- Use visual aids to illustrate the concept and show how it increases resource utilization and efficiency.
- Discuss practical scenarios where OS-level virtualisation is beneficial, such as testing new software or providing isolated environments for students with sensitive projects.
- Emphasize the trade-off between security and compatibility to spark a discussion on balancing these competing demands.

### Interactive Activities for Operating system level virtualisation
Here are two distinct items based on the provided strengths and weaknesses:

**Debate Topic:**

**"Operating System Level Virtualization is Worth the Cost of Complexity."**

This debate topic pits the benefits of improved security through isolation (strength) against the potential drawbacks of guest OS modification and compatibility issues (weakness). Students will need to argue for or against the statement, considering both sides' perspectives.

Some possible argument starters:

*   For: "Operating system level virtualization provides an additional layer of security that is essential in today's interconnected world. The benefits far outweigh the costs."
*   Against: "While operating system level virtualization offers improved security, the potential for compatibility issues and guest OS modification is too great a risk to ignore."

**What If Scenario Question:**

**"A small business is considering adopting operating system level virtualization to improve security and reduce hardware costs. However, their IT staff has limited experience with virtualized environments. Would you recommend implementing this technology, and if so, what measures would you take to mitigate potential compatibility issues?"**

This scenario question forces students to apply the concept of operating system level virtualization in a real-world context, considering both the benefits (improved security) and drawbacks (compatibility issues). Students will need to weigh the pros and cons and justify their decision based on the trade-offs involved.

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualization
**Story Module: "The Smart Virtual Machine"**

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine you're an IT manager at a large corporation with thousands of employees working on different operating systems and software applications. Your task is to create virtual machines for each employee, but the problem is that these virtual machines are taking up too much processing power and slowing down your entire system. This was the challenge that existed before the concept of para-virtualization.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a brilliant engineer discovered that by modifying the guest operating system to use hooks for improved machine execution simulation, they could significantly improve performance without sacrificing compatibility with the underlying hardware. This breakthrough was made possible by using a Type1 Hypervisor, which enabled para-virtualization.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The impact of para-virtualization was transformative. By making some modifications to the guest operating system, IT managers like our protagonist were able to create virtual machines that could run multiple applications simultaneously without slowing down the entire system. This meant increased productivity for employees and reduced costs for the company. However, there were also trade-offs – the guest operating system needed to be modified, which introduced compatibility issues.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an IT manager facing the challenge of creating efficient virtual machines for thousands of employees.

3. Introduce para-virtualization as the solution
4. Explain how it works (using hooks for improved machine execution simulation enabled by Type1 Hypervisor)
5. Discuss the impact and trade-offs

#### Analogy
Think of a virtual machine like an apartment building – para-virtualization is like installing elevators that can take multiple people at once, making the entire system more efficient.

**Timing:** This story should take around 15-20 minutes to tell, depending on class size and engagement.

### Interactive Activities for Para-virtualization
Here are two distinct items based on the provided strengths and weaknesses of para-virtualization:

**1. Debate Topic: "Para-Virtualization is a Double-Edged Sword in Performance Enhancement"**

**Statement:** While para-virtualization can significantly improve machine execution simulation, thereby boosting performance, the need for guest operating system modification outweighs these benefits.

**Debate Positions:**

*   **Affirmative (For):** Para-virtualization is an effective solution that provides a balance between improved performance and manageable compatibility issues.
*   **Negative (Against):** The risks associated with modifying the guest operating system are too high, making para-virtualization an unwise choice for most applications.

**2. 'What If' Scenario Question:**

**Scenario:** Suppose you're a DevOps engineer responsible for deploying a new cloud-based application that requires exceptional performance and reliability. You have two options:

*   **Option A:** Implement para-virtualization to leverage the improved machine execution simulation, which has been shown to boost performance by up to 30%.
*   **Option B:** Opt for full virtualization, which doesn't require guest operating system modifications but might compromise on performance due to its less efficient resource allocation.

**Question:** Which option would you choose and why? Justify your decision based on the strengths and weaknesses of para-virtualization.

## Teaching Module: Full virtualization
**Full Virtualization Story Module**

### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Dr. Patel was an IT Manager at a large corporation with multiple departments and diverse operating systems in use. One of her biggest challenges was maintaining compatibility across all these systems, which often led to frustration and wasted resources when she had to troubleshoot or upgrade software.

She remembered the countless hours spent on setting up a new employee's laptop, ensuring that their Windows 10 OS would run smoothly alongside the company's custom Linux-based applications. It was a tedious process, involving tweaking settings, configuring permissions, and praying that everything worked seamlessly together.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while attending a tech conference, Dr. Patel stumbled upon a presentation on full virtualization. She learned about how it fully simulates all the hardware of the underlying device by providing a virtual machine. This means every guest operating system could run within this virtual environment without needing any modifications.

The presenter explained that with full virtualization:

*   Simulates all the hardware of the underlying device, ensuring compatibility across different OS.
*   Provides a virtual machine where guests can be easily added or removed as needed.

This concept seemed too good to be true – an answer to her long-standing problem. She couldn't wait to try it out on her team's systems.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Dr. Patel decided to implement full virtualization in their IT infrastructure. The impact was immediate and profound:

*   **Flexibility and Compatibility**: They could now run any operating system without worrying about compatibility issues, streamlining the setup process for new employees and reducing troubleshooting time.
*   **Reduced Overhead**: While it had a higher performance overhead compared to other types of virtualization, the long-term benefits far outweighed this drawback. It reduced their workload significantly, allowing them to focus on more strategic initiatives.

However, she also learned about its limitations: full virtualization might have a higher performance hit than other types of virtualization, requiring a careful balance between functionality and efficiency. This trade-off was manageable for her team's needs but worth noting as part of the broader strategy.

### Storytelling Hooks

*   **Dramatic Question**: "Could making our computers 'dumber' actually make them more powerful?"
*   **Point of View**: From the perspective of an IT Manager facing a challenge, exploring how full virtualization can solve common problems in managing diverse operating systems across different departments.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

*   **Pacing**:
    *   Pause after introducing the problem to let students empathize with Dr. Patel's situation.
    *   Ask a question like "How many times have you struggled with compatibility issues?" before moving on to the solution.
    *   After explaining full virtualization, ask students to imagine implementing this in their own work settings.
*   **Analogy**: Compare full virtualization to a container ship. Just as containers can hold and transport different goods without affecting each other's journey, a guest OS can run within a virtual machine without needing modifications to the host system.

This story aims to make the concept of full virtualization more relatable by grounding it in real-world challenges and solutions. It encourages students to think about how this technology could solve their own problems or improve work processes.

### Interactive Activities for Full virtualization
Here are two distinct items:

**Debate Topic:**

**Title:** "Full Virtualization: A Double-Edged Sword in Modern Computing"

**Statement:** "While full virtualization offers unparalleled flexibility by supporting a wide range of guest operating systems without modification, its higher performance overhead makes it impractical for real-time applications."

**Instructions:** Divide the class into two groups and assign each group a position to defend. Group A will argue that full virtualization's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, while Group B will counter with evidence that the performance overhead is too significant to ignore. Encourage students to use logical reasoning and supporting examples to convince their peers of their stance.

**What If Scenario Question:**

**Scenario:** "A cloud service provider needs to host a high-performance video editing software for its clients. The software requires seamless and real-time processing capabilities, but it also needs to run on multiple operating systems without modification. Should the provider opt for full virtualization or another type of virtualization to ensure optimal performance?"

**Instructions:** Ask students to justify their choice by considering both the strengths (supporting a wide range of guest operating systems) and weaknesses (higher performance overhead) of full virtualization. How would they balance the trade-offs to meet the client's requirements? Would they opt for another type of virtualization, such as hardware-assisted virtualization or paravirtualization, instead?
