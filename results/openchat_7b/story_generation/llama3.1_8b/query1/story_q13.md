## Teaching Module: DevOps
**The Story**

### The Problem (Event)
In a large tech firm, the software development team was like a fire brigade rushing to put out fires. Every time a new feature was requested, they would frantically code it and then hand it over to the IT operations team, who would try to deploy it without much communication or collaboration. This led to long deployment times, frequent errors, and frustrated customers.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a young developer named Maya stumbled upon an article about DevOps. She realized that this culture and way of working emphasized collaboration between business stakeholders, software developers, and IT operations teams. With DevOps, the development team could work closely with IT to automate testing, deployment, and monitoring. This streamlined process reduced errors, increased efficiency, and enabled cross-functional teams to make informed decisions.

Maya introduced DevOps practices to her team, and they started working in sprints, automating tasks, and sharing knowledge across departments. The IT operations team was no longer just a 'deploy-or-die' unit; they were now integral partners in the development process.

### The Impact (Meaning)
As Maya's team implemented DevOps, their deployment times decreased dramatically, from weeks to hours. Errors dropped significantly, and customer satisfaction soared. Maya realized that DevOps wasn't just about technology; it was a culture shift towards collaboration, continuous improvement, and mutual respect between teams.

**Storytelling Hooks**

### Dramatic Question
What if your team's inefficiencies were not a result of bad communication but a lack of understanding among departments?

### Point of View
From the perspective of a development manager who wants to improve her team's efficiency and collaboration with IT operations.

**Classroom Delivery Tips**

### Pacing

* Pause after describing the problem to ask: "Have you ever experienced a frustrating delay or error due to poor communication between teams?"
* After introducing DevOps, pause again to ask: "How would your current work process change if you implemented DevOps practices?"

### Analogy
Explain DevOps as a symphony orchestra. Each team member is a musician with their unique role and contribution. Just like how each instrument works together in harmony to create beautiful music, DevOps ensures that all teams – business, development, and operations – work together seamlessly to produce high-quality software and services.

**Additional Tips**

* Use visual aids or diagrams to illustrate the benefits of collaboration and automation.
* Encourage students to share their own experiences with inefficient communication or processes and how they could apply DevOps principles to improve them.

### Interactive Activities for DevOps
Here are two educational activity elements tailored to the DevOps concept:

### Debate Topic: "Automation in DevOps Leads to Job Losses"

**Statement:** "The automation of tasks through DevOps processes will ultimately lead to significant job losses within IT teams, making the adoption of this methodology a net negative for employees."

This debate topic pits those who support the idea that increased efficiency and productivity through automation outweigh potential job losses against those who argue that the automation of tasks directly threatens job security. It encourages students to weigh the benefits (e.g., faster delivery times, improved quality) against the costs (job loss), fostering critical thinking about the human impact of technological advancements.

### What If Scenario Question: "The Small Business Dilemma"

**Scenario:** A small e-commerce business is considering implementing DevOps practices. However, the owner has just laid off several employees due to financial constraints and is hesitant to invest in what seems like a large-scale initiative requiring significant upfront costs for training and infrastructure upgrades.

**Question:** How would you advise the owner regarding the implementation of DevOps given these constraints? Would it be beneficial at this time, or should the focus remain on stabilizing the business through cost-cutting measures?

This scenario question encourages students to apply their understanding of DevOps by considering its short-term costs against long-term benefits. It also introduces a real-world dilemma that requires balancing different priorities (economic stability vs. future-proofing through technological advancements), promoting critical thinking about practical implementation strategies.

Both activities are designed to engage students in discussions and problem-solving, deepening their understanding of the trade-offs involved with adopting DevOps methodologies.

## Teaching Module: CI/CD Workflows
**The Story**

### The Problem (Event)

Imagine it's the year 2025 and you're part of a team developing a new software application for a popular streaming service. Your team works tirelessly to meet the tight deadlines set by your customers. However, with each update, there are more bugs and issues reported. It takes days or even weeks to identify and fix these problems, causing frustration among both developers and users.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)

One day, while researching ways to improve efficiency, you stumble upon the concept of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows in DevOps. You learn that CI/CD is a set of processes and tools that automate the integration and deployment of code changes into production environments. This means:

- **Automating the process of integrating code changes**: No more manual checks or lengthy reviews, ensuring each update is properly integrated before moving forward.
- **Automating the deployment of new software versions**: Updates are automatically deployed to production, reducing the time between updates and making it easier to respond to customer feedback.

### The Impact (Meaning)

The introduction of CI/CD workflows revolutionizes your team's development process. It improves efficiency by automating tasks, reduces human error because there's less manual intervention, and allows for quicker response to customer feedback. While there are no significant weaknesses to this approach, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution, requiring careful setup and maintenance to ensure smooth operations.

### Dramatic Question
Could making your development process more automated actually make it smarter?

### Point of View
Consider the story from the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in keeping up with the demands of a rapidly changing software landscape.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing

1. Introduce the problem and challenges faced by developers (pause for understanding).
2. Describe the concept of CI/CD and its automation benefits.
3. Discuss the impact of implementing CI/CD workflows on development efficiency, human error, and customer feedback response time.

#### Analogy
Think of a production line in a factory. Just as machines work together to produce goods more efficiently than manual labor alone, CI/CD workflows are like these machines for your software development process, automating integration and deployment to reduce errors and increase speed.

**Additional Tips:**

- Use visual aids (diagrams or flowcharts) to illustrate the concept of CI/CD.
- Discuss case studies or real-world examples where CI/CD has significantly improved software development efficiency.
- Encourage students to reflect on their own projects or processes they can improve with CI/CD workflows.

### Interactive Activities for CI/CD Workflows
Here are two items tailored to the provided strengths and weaknesses:

**Debate Topic:**
**"Automation vs. Agility: Should CI/CD Workflows Prioritize Speed Over Human Intervention?"**

This debate topic pits the strength of 'quicker response to customer feedback' against a hypothetical weakness that doesn't exist in reality but is created for the sake of argumentation. Students can argue for or against prioritizing speed, considering potential drawbacks such as increased risk due to automated processes and decreased flexibility if changes aren't properly assessed by humans.

**What If Scenario Question:**
**"A Small Startup with Limited Resources Needs to Implement CI/CD Workflows Quickly to Meet an Upcoming Deadline. However, the Team is Concerned That Relying Heavily on Automated Processes Might Compromise Quality Control."**

This question forces students to weigh the benefits of efficiency and speed against potential drawbacks such as errors due to lack of human oversight. Students must justify their choice based on whether they believe the startup should prioritize quick implementation over thorough quality control, considering the trade-offs and how these might impact customer satisfaction in the long run.
