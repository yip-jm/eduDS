## Teaching Module: Microservices
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

Imagine you are in charge of developing an e-commerce website that allows customers to browse products and complete purchases online. Your team is working on a monolithic application that handles all aspects of the site, including product listings, checkout process, user authentication, and more. The problem is that as your business grows, so does this single application. You're struggling with maintaining it, updating features, and adapting to new requirements.

One day, you come across a concept called "Microservices". This idea suggests breaking down the monolithic application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of each other. Each service focuses on one specific functionality like product listings, user authentication, or checkout process. These services communicate with each other through an API network.

The impact is enormous: your team can now develop and deploy these microservices much faster because they are not tied to the monolithic application's progress. Furthermore, you gain more flexibility by scaling individual services independently according to their specific needs. Overall, this leads to better maintainability and scalability for your e-commerce website.

2. Storytelling Hooks
