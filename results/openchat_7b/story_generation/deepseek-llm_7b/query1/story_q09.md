## Teaching Module: Cluster
1. The Story (Problem → Solution → Impact)

Once upon a time, in the world of distributed applications and cloud infrastructure, we faced the challenge of maintaining efficiency while managing our growing workload. As workloads increased, it was difficult to keep up with scaling manually or relying on traditional servers. This was an issue because it not only took significant resources but also posed challenges for rapid deployment and efficient resource allocation.

One day, amidst this chaos, someone discovered a powerful tool that would change the game forever - Kubernetes clusters! 

Kubernetes clusters are groups of interconnected nodes, where each node plays its role in running applications or services within a distributed system. A cluster consists of at least one master node and several worker nodes which communicate to ensure smooth functioning of our workloads. With this newfound knowledge, we now had the power to manage scalability effortlessly!

Why is it important? Kubernetes clusters enable rapid scaling and workload portability by providing a flexible and efficient way to distribute applications across multiple servers. This results in cost savings, improved resource utilization, and faster deployment times. However, there are potential trade-offs such as higher complexity when managing the cluster or limited support for specific use cases.

2. Storytelling Hooks

* "Can you imagine a world where your favorite apps could be served to users instantly without worrying about server capacity?"
* From the perspective of an engineer aiming to deploy and manage workloads efficiently, Kubernetes clusters open up new possibilities in managing distributed applications.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* Pacing: When discussing the definition of a cluster with students, take your time to explain each component - master node and worker nodes, their roles, and how they interact within a cluster. It's crucial for them to understand these fundamental concepts before delving into the impact of clusters in distributed systems.

* Analogy: Imagine an orchestra performing together! The conductor (master node) is responsible for leading the group by signaling when each musician should play their part, and everyone listens attentively to ensure harmonious music. Each instrument (worker nodes) plays its role without needing guidance from other instruments; they're simply following instructions from the conductor.

## Teaching Module: Master
1. The Story (Problem → Solution → Impact)

---

The Problem (Event): Before Kubernetes, managing containerized applications was quite challenging and time-consuming. Developers had to manually monitor and control each node's behavior, ensuring that they were running efficiently and effectively. This often led to a lot of wasted resources and potential bottlenecks in the system.

---

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Enter the Kubernetes master – a machine responsible for controlling the entire cluster and coordinating tasks among worker nodes. The master node is essentially the brain that manages container lifecycles, ensuring efficient resource allocation, and task scheduling within the cluster. It's designed to handle complex application workloads in an easy-to-use platform.

---

The Impact (Meaning): With Kubernetes masters at our disposal, we can now enjoy a more straightforward management experience for our containerized applications. They not only manage resources efficiently but also ensure that tasks are assigned and executed effectively across the cluster of worker nodes. This means developers no longer have to worry about manual monitoring or controlling individual nodes – saving time and effort while focusing on what matters most, like building better software!

2. Storytelling Hooks:
- Dramatic Question: Can you imagine managing containerized applications without Kubernetes?
- Point of View: From the perspective of a developer seeking an efficient way to run their apps in the cloud.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

* Pacing: When discussing the benefits and challenges, take your time to emphasize how much easier it is now thanks to master nodes managing tasks across worker nodes. This will help students fully grasp the impact of having a centralized control system for containerized applications.
* Analogies: Think about using an illustration like "Imagine you're juggling 10 balls in the air and suddenly, someone hands you a magic wand that keeps them all balanced without your input." The master node is kind of like that magical wand!

### Interactive Activities for Master
1. Debate Topic: "Is Master node scheduling an efficient resource allocation method?"

Statement: The master node ensures efficient resource allocation and task scheduling in distributed computing systems by managing multiple tasks concurrently, prioritizing workloads, and handling dependencies between them. This leads to a more balanced distribution of resources among various processes, thus increasing overall system performance. However, this may lead to increased complexity in the management process, potentially causing difficulties when dealing with unpredictable workload fluctuations or changes in resource requirements.

2. What If Scenario Question: "In an organization that is implementing Master node scheduling for distributed computing tasks, there's a sudden 30% increase in user requests on a particular day. The system is already running at approximately 85% capacity due to normal daily operations. How would the master node handle this surge of new requests? Would it prioritize older tasks over newer ones as usual or adapt its scheduling algorithm according to the increased workload?"

This scenario forces students to consider how Master node scheduling might deal with unexpected changes in resource demand, prompting them to evaluate whether the trade-offs related to efficient allocation and task scheduling are worth considering.

## Teaching Module: Kubelet
1. The Story (Problem  ->  Solution  ->  Impact)

In an open source project that aims to manage distributed systems across various computing environments, there was a challenge of maintaining containerized applications running consistently and reliably. This posed difficulties in keeping track of containers' status and ensuring they were launched and maintained correctly without manual intervention.

One day, while browsing through the Kubernetes documentation, I stumbled upon 'Kubelet.' It immediately caught my attention as it seemed to be an integral part of this distributed system management tool. Curious about its role within a cluster, I started researching further into its responsibilities and how it impacts container reliability and availability in complex computing environments.

The concept of Kubelet brings immense significance to the world of distributed systems. It plays a critical role in maintaining stateful containers by ensuring they are running efficiently without any issues or inconsistencies that could impact overall system performance. With Kubelet's assistance, we can maintain high levels of reliability and availability for our containerized applications across various computing environments.

2. Storytelling Hooks
* "Can you imagine a world where your apps were consistently available, no matter the network conditions? Well, that's exactly what Kubernetes and its Kubelet concept offers."
1. Classroom Delivery Tips:
- Pacing: When discussing Kubelet in class, take time to explain how this service ensures container consistency across various computing environments. Ask questions like, "What challenges do we face when maintaining distributed systems?" or "How does Kubelet help us maintain reliable and available containers?"
- Analogy: A simple analogy can be comparing the role of a teacher ensuring students understand their lessons by actively monitoring them and providing resources to solve problems. Similarly, Kubelet acts as an attentive overseer for our containerized applications in complex computing environments.

### Interactive Activities for Kubelet
1. Debate Topic: "Is Kubelet's focus on container reliability at the expense of system efficiency?"

Strengths: The primary strength of the kubelet is in ensuring container reliability by providing a stable environment for containers to run within, avoiding common issues such as resource exhaustion and crashes caused by high load. By doing so, it helps maintain the smooth operation of applications that are deployed on Kubernetes clusters.

Weaknesses: The focus on maintaining container reliability might come at the expense of system efficiency. Since kubelet has a role in managing local storage and network resources within containers, it can consume more CPU cycles than necessary if not implemented properly or optimized for performance. This could potentially affect overall cluster throughput and degrade Kubernetes' ability to scale efficiently under high loads.

2. What If Scenario: "A company is deploying their web application on a Kubernetes cluster with the kubelet enabled by default. They notice that some of their deployments are slower than expected, despite having adequate resources allocated for each container. How would you troubleshoot this issue?"

Answer: To address this situation, students could examine the system logs to identify any errors or warnings related to kubelet performance issues. If there is a noticeable difference in response times between containers that have different configurations (e.g., CPU and memory limits), it might be due to inefficient kubelet settings for resource management.

To resolve the issue, students can make changes to kubelet configurations such as adjusting resource requests or limits on individual containers, enabling garbage collection, or optimizing the Cgroups settings. By doing so, they should see improved application performance within the Kubernetes cluster, while maintaining a balance between container reliability and system efficiency.

## Teaching Module: Pod
1. The Story (Problem  ->  Solution  ->  Impact)

In the world of distributed applications and microservices, managing containerized workloads was becoming increasingly complex as more developers began to use Kubernetes. With numerous containers running on different machines in various locations, it became a challenge for administrators to ensure that all services were working together seamlessly. There was an urgent need for efficient resource allocation and task scheduling.

One day, while trying to optimize the performance of a containerized application, a group of developers stumbled upon something revolutionary - pods! They realized they could group containers into smaller, more manageable units called 'Pods' in Kubernetes, which would enable them to efficiently allocate resources, schedule tasks, and monitor services. This discovery transformed how they managed their applications, leading to increased productivity and better performance for the distributed system.

2. Storytelling Hooks:
- Dramatic Question: "Can we simplify container orchestration by organizing our containers into smaller groups?"
- Point of View: "From the perspective of a developer seeking an efficient solution."

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

* Pacing: When discussing resource allocation and task scheduling, pause to let students imagine how it might impact their work on distributed applications.
* Analogy: Imagine you have multiple toy cars that need fuel (resources) to run properly. Before having the concept of pods in Kubernetes, these cars are driving around aimlessly - inefficiently using resources and not interacting with each other effectively. After understanding the power of pods, they form groups based on their needs, allowing for more effective resource allocation among them, leading to smoother performance across the toy car world (distributed system).

### Interactive Activities for Pod
1. Debate Topic: "Are Pods Better than Traditional Servers for Running Containerized Applications?"
Strengths: Pods provide scalability and efficiency in managing containerized applications. They are easy to deploy, manage, and scale.
Weaknesses: Pods may be more complex to set up and maintain compared to traditional servers. They also have limited fault tolerance as they rely on a single node hosting all the containers for that pod.
2. What If Scenario Question: In an organization with a large number of containerized applications running, the IT team needs to decide whether to use pods or traditional servers for their new project. The project requires high availability and must be able to handle sudden spikes in traffic. Which do you think would be better suited for this scenario - pod or traditional server? Explain your choice based on the strengths and weaknesses of each option.
