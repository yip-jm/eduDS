## Teaching Module: Docker
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

---

The Problem: Imagine you're working on an important project and need to collaborate with your team members who are using different operating systems or hardware configurations. Installing all necessary software and dependencies can be a tedious process, requiring hours of setup time for everyone involved. The existing virtual machine (VM) based solution doesnâ€™t help much either as it still requires you to install the same environment on each system before working on your project.

The 'Aha!' Moment: Enter Docker! This incredible containerization platform was designed specifically with these challenges in mind, allowing software packaging that includes all dependencies and can run smoothly on any system without needing a specific setup beforehand. By using Docker containers, you could easily share the same development environment across multiple systems while also maintaining security for each project instance by isolating it from other applications running simultaneously.

The Impact: The introduction of Docker has transformed how software is deployed and managed in both personal and enterprise environments. It simplifies collaboration on projects among teams with diverse computing setups, increases efficiency in deploying new features to production, reduces costs associated with IT infrastructure maintenance, and accelerates development cycles by providing a consistent testing environment for code changes.

2. Storytelling Hooks:

---

Dramatic Question: Can simplifying the process of installing software on different machines lead to faster progress in your project?
Point of View: From the perspective of an agile developer aiming to save time and effort while working with a team.

Pacing: When discussing Docker, it is essential to spend some time explaining how containers work before diving into its specific use cases within development teams or companies dealing with complex computing environments like HPC applications. 
Analogy: Imagine your favorite application as a box of crayons - each color represents an individual dependency required for running the software smoothly, while Docker's containerization platform allows you to neatly pack them all together in one neat package that can be shared among friends without any fear of colors bleeding into others' boxes.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
1. Debate Topic: "Is Docker's reliance on hypervisor-based virtualization a significant weakness in comparison to other containerization technologies?"
Pros of this debate topic: It encourages critical thinking about the strengths and weaknesses of different containerization technologies, prompting students to evaluate whether or not performance overhead is an acceptable trade-off for ease of use.
Cons of this debate topic: Some students may struggle with understanding hypervisor-based virtualization, making it difficult for them to argue effectively in favor of Docker's strengths against its potential weaknesses.
2. What If Scenario Question: "If you were tasked with creating a web application that needs to run on various platforms and hardware configurations, would you choose Docker over other containerization technologies like Podman or LXD? Justify your choice based on the trade-offs of each technology."
Pros of this scenario question: It allows students to apply their understanding of Docker's strengths (ease of use and package all dependencies) while also considering its weaknesses (performance overhead). This prompts them to think critically about which technology best suits a specific application or situation.
Cons of this scenario question: Some students may struggle with evaluating the trade-offs between different containerization technologies, leading to less nuanced answers that focus solely on Docker's strengths instead of addressing potential downsides.

## Teaching Module: Singularity
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

In the world of high-performance computing (HPC), scientists and researchers were constantly faced with a unique challenge. They needed powerful computers that could quickly process large amounts of data, but these machines were often difficult to use and maintain. One particularly frustrating issue was hardware and network isolation, which made it nearly impossible for users to collaborate on projects while keeping their sensitive information secure.

Enter Singularity - the revolutionary containerization platform designed specifically for HPC environments. It was developed with portability in mind so that researchers could easily move their work from one machine to another without any disruption or loss of data. But how did it achieve this seemingly impossible task? 

At its core, Singularity is a tool that allows users to create "containers" - isolated virtual environments that contain all the software and dependencies required for an application to run correctly. These containers are then stored on disk, making them easily transportable between different HPC machines. When executed, these containers provide complete hardware and network isolation, allowing researchers to work collaboratively without compromising data security.

2. Storytelling Hooks:

- Dramatic Question: "Could a simple containerization platform revolutionize the way scientists process complex data sets?"
- Point of View: "From the perspective of an HPC researcher faced with hardware isolation challenges."

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

* Pacing: As you explain Singularity, take time to discuss how it addresses the problem of hardware and network isolation in HPC environments. Encourage your students to ask questions about the process behind containerization and its impact on collaboration in research settings.

* Analogy: Imagine if a group of friends were all using different smartphones with unique apps - they'd have trouble sharing photos or ideas effectively, right? Singularity is like giving these friends a shared phone that can easily switch between apps (the applications), so everyone stays connected and on the same page while keeping their personal information secure.

### Interactive Activities for Singularity
1. Debate Topic: "Is Singularity an optimal solution for high performance computing applications due to its limited general applicability?"
2. What If? Scenario Question: Imagine you are part of a team working in the field of climate modeling. Your organization has recently adopted a singularity platform, but your results have shown less accuracy than traditional HPC solutions. You're asked to justify whether the Singularity platform is still worth investing in despite its shortcomings for this specific application.

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

The Problem (Event): In a world of complex and resource-intensive virtualization solutions like hypervisor-based virtual machines (VMs), IT administrators faced significant challenges in terms of hardware utilization, performance overhead, and energy consumption. They needed an efficient solution to host multiple applications on a single physical machine while keeping the resources shared between containers.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Linux Containers (LXC) emerged as a promising alternative, providing a lightweight way of implementing process isolation within the Linux kernel itself. By leveraging existing Linux capabilities and features like cgroups and namespaces, developers could achieve hardware and network isolation for individual processes without relying on traditional hypervisor-based virtualization solutions such as VirtualBox or VMware.

The Impact (Meaning): With LXC, IT administrators can now efficiently host multiple containers with their respective resources on a single physical machine while still sharing system-level services like storage and networking among different user spaces. This lightweight solution reduces hardware penalties and performance overheads, making it an ideal choice for resource-constrained environments such as data centers or cloud computing platforms.

2. Storytelling Hooks:

Dramatic Question: "Could a simpler approach to virtualization help IT administrators better manage their resources without compromising on efficiency?"
Point of View: From the perspective of an engineering student learning about containerization technologies, understanding how Linux Containers can revolutionize resource utilization in distributed computing environments is critical.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

Pacing: Start with a brief introduction to LXC and its significance in modern IT environments. Then gradually delve deeper into its core features and applications while providing real-life examples for better comprehension.

Analogy: Imagine you have multiple friends who share a single room, each wanting individual space without purchasing or renting another property. With Linux Containers, they can all use the same physical space by partitioning their personal spaces using cgroups and namespaces, ensuring resource isolation between them while still sharing some system-level services like light switches and Wi-Fi access points.

### Interactive Activities for Linux Containers (LXC)
1. Debate Topic: "Should LXC be adopted for HPC environments despite its limitations?"
Statement: The use of Linux Containers (LXC) in high performance computing (HPC) environments would significantly increase efficiency, but given their lack of specific design for such environments, it may not be the most appropriate choice. 

Strengths Argument: LXC's shared resource management could lead to a more economical allocation of hardware resources while ensuring isolation between processes running inside different containers. This advantage could potentially enhance performance in HPC scenarios where parallel computing is necessary.

Weaknesses Argument: The main limitation of LXC for HPC environments lies in its potential inability to leverage the full power of the host machine's computational capabilities, which are crucial when dealing with complex algorithms and multi-tasking processes. This could potentially limit the efficiency gains that might be realized by implementing LXC in these environments.
2. 'What If' Scenario Question: "A research team is working on a project involving several computationally intensive tasks for HPC simulations. They have been considering using Linux Containers (LXC) as part of their workflow, but are unsure if it would effectively address the demands of their project. What potential trade-offs might they face by adopting LXC versus not?"
Answer: If the research team chooses to use LXC in their HPC simulations, they may experience a more efficient allocation and management of computational resources as well as increased isolation between processes running inside different containers. However, these advantages could be offset by reduced performance due to limited interaction with the host machine's computational capabilities, leading to slower execution times or decreased accuracy for some tasks. On the other hand, if they choose not to use LXC, they might lose out on those benefits and potentially face issues related to resource sharing between different processes within their simulations. This could lead to increased hardware requirements and potential inefficiencies in allocating resources among multiple projects.
