## Teaching Module: Operating system level virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

Once upon a time, in a world filled with computers running various operating systems and software programs, there was a big challenge facing computer engineers. Imagine having to manage multiple machines that each had different needs, requirements, and resources. Not only did this create inefficiencies but it also made managing these machines an enormous headache for IT professionals. 

Enter the concept of Operating System Level Virtualisation: a revolutionary solution to the problem! This 'aha!' moment was triggered by the discovery of using isolation mechanisms to provide users with virtual environments similar to dedicated servers, on the same physical hardware. The impact? Well, this amazing technology allowed multiple users to run their own isolated environments, effectively increasing resource utilization and efficiency.

2. Storytelling Hooks:
- Dramatic Question: Can a single piece of hardware host different operating systems without any conflicts or inefficiencies? 
- Point of View: From the perspective of an engineer who wants to maximize resources while maintaining system security.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:
To engage your students in this concept, begin by sharing the dramatic question and asking them if they think it's possible for a single machine to support different operating systems without any conflicts or inefficiencies. You can also provide an analogy that helps illustrate OS level virtualisation - imagine each user on a shared computer as a passenger sitting next to one another in a bus, with their own privacy partition (or 'virtual environment') between them, and the bus driver managing resources efficiently.

### Interactive Activities for Operating system level virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Is operating system level virtualisation worth it for increased security at the cost of potential compatibility issues?"

2. What if Scenario Question: Imagine you are a software engineer working on creating an application that requires high levels of data privacy and security. You need to choose between two different environments - one using real hardware, and another with operating system level virtualisation. Which environment would be better for your project? Explain your choice by considering the trade-offs related to increased security through isolation versus potential compatibility issues with guest operating systems.

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualization
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

---

In the late 20th century, computer scientists and engineers faced an interesting challenge. They needed to allow multiple operating systems to run on a single machine without causing conflicts or slowing performance. This was critical for developing efficient and cost-effective computing solutions. The existing methods of virtualisation were not able to provide this level of compatibility between the hardware and guest operating system.

One day, while tinkering with different types of hypervisors (software that manages multiple operating systems on a single piece of hardware), a group of engineers stumbled upon an innovative solution - para-virtualization. This new method allowed for improved performance by using hooks in the guest operating system to simulate machine execution more effectively.

The impact of this discovery was monumental. Para-virtualisation offered a much-needed improvement in compatibility between the underlying hardware and guest operating systems, leading to better performance and cost savings. It revolutionized the way we think about multi-system computing on a single platform.

* To help students understand para-virtualization, start by asking them what they know about virtual machines. Then, draw a simple analogy: imagine a person trying to share an apartment with another tenant who has very different habits and needs. They might have trouble living together peacefully if not for some rules or hooks that both tenants agree on beforehand. This helps illustrate the idea of para-virtualization in a relatable way.
* When discussing performance, show how traditional virtualisation methods can cause slowdowns by using examples like a busy kitchen with too many chefs trying to prepare meals simultaneously (a situation where conflicts occur and efficiency declines). Explain that with para-virtualization, there's an improvement in the efficiency of resource allocation, making it easier for multiple operating systems to work together without interfering.
* To further engage students, create scenarios related to their interests or experiences. For example, if they play video games online, discuss how para-virtualisation can help improve performance and reduce lag times by allowing different types of operating systems (like Windows vs macOS) to cohabit a gaming machine without causing conflicts. This connects the concept directly with real-world applications that students might be familiar with.

### Interactive Activities for Para-virtualization
1. Debate Topic: "Should para-virtualization be pursued despite potential compatibility issues with guest operating systems?"
Statement: Despite improved performance through hooks for machine execution simulation in para-virtualization, it may introduce significant compatibility issues that could compromise system stability and security if the modified guest operating system is not adequately tested or supported. 
2. What If Scenario Question: "If you were tasked to implement a software application on a server using para-virtualization, but encountered frequent compatibility problems with the guest OS, what trade-offs would you consider when deciding between pursuing these issues and moving forward without them?"

## Teaching Module: Full virtualization
1. The Story (Problem → Solution → Impact)

In an era of diverse operating systems and devices, one challenge faced by computer engineers was supporting multiple software platforms on a single hardware device. This limitation often led to complications when it came to compatibility, flexibility, and system performance.

One day, during a brainstorming session among the team of developers at Virtual Machines Inc., an 'Aha!' moment occurred - full virtualization! As they dove deeper into this concept, they discovered that it was like creating a magical machine that could fully simulate all the hardware functions of an underlying device. This meant any operating system could run on the virtual machine without modification, providing greater flexibility and compatibility for various software systems.

The impact of full virtualization is profound! It not only overcomes the limitations faced in supporting diverse operating systems but also enables a wide range of guest operating systems to be accommodated without needing modifications to hardware or software. This allows engineers to focus on developing innovative applications rather than being bogged down by compatibility issues, ultimately leading to improved performance for their users.

However, it's important to consider the trade-offs as well; full virtualization may have a higher performance overhead compared to other types of virtualisation. Despite this drawback, the benefits of greater flexibility and compatibility often outweigh the slight decrease in system efficiency. This incredible technology paved the way for an era where operating systems can run seamlessly on various hardware platforms!

2. Storytelling Hooks
- Dramatic Question: "Can we truly harness the power of multiple software platforms without being chained to a single device?"
- Point of View: "From the perspective of a computer engineer, who wants to build a versatile and efficient system."

3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- Pacing: When discussing full virtualization with students, take your time to explain each point in detail before moving on to the next one. Encourage questions from them along the way!
- Analogy: To make this concept relatable for younger learners or those new to computer science concepts, describe it as a "virtual magic machine" that can transform any operating system into running smoothly on different hardware devices without needing modifications!

### Interactive Activities for Full virtualization
