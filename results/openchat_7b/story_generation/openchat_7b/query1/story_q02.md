## Teaching Module: Operating system level virtualisation
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a bustling city, there was a large data center that served multiple clients from different industries. Each client had specific needs and required their own server to run their applications. As the demand for servers grew, the data center faced a serious challenge: they had limited physical hardware, and all these clients needed separate dedicated servers to operate efficiently.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, an ingenious engineer named Alex came up with an idea that could save the day. He proposed a new concept called "Operating system level virtualisation." This approach would isolate users in virtual environments similar to dedicated servers. However, it required the guest operating system to be modified and use a set of hooks to improve machine execution simulation.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
This innovative solution allowed multiple users to run their own isolated environments on the same physical hardware. This increased resource utilization and efficiency in the data center. Not only did it solve the problem, but it also improved security by isolating user environments from each other. However, Alex was aware of a potential weakness - modifying the guest operating system could introduce compatibility issues.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in managing a large data center efficiently and securely.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
#### Pacing:
- When introducing the problem, pause to let students imagine the challenges faced by the data center.
- During the 'Aha!' moment, pause to let students ponder how operating system level virtualisation could solve the issue.
- As you discuss the impact, pause after mentioning strengths and weaknesses to ask students what they think about the trade-offs.

#### Analogy:
Think of a busy restaurant where each customer needs a separate table with specific settings. Operating system level virtualisation is like having one big table that can be magically divided into separate, customized spaces for each customer, allowing more people to enjoy their meal without crowding or confusion.

### Interactive Activities for Operating system level virtualisation
 1. Debate Topic: "Operating system level virtualisation enhances security by isolating user environments; however, it may introduce compatibility issues due to the need for guest operating system modification."

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a company that wants to use operating system level virtualisation to enhance its cybersecurity but is unsure about potential compatibility issues. How would you advise them on whether or not to proceed, considering both the security benefits and the possible drawbacks of this approach?"

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualization
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event): The Quest for Faster Computers

Once upon a time in a land of computers, there was a powerful sorceress named "Para-virtualization." She lived in the realm of Type1 Hypervisor, where virtual machines roamed free. Many of these creatures were slow and clumsy, struggling to keep up with their real-world counterparts. The villagers longed for faster, more efficient machines, but none seemed to be able to deliver.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): The Discovery of the Magic Spell

One day, a young wizard named "Type1 Hypervisor" stumbled upon Para-virtualization in the ancient scrolls of his library. He read that she could grant the guest operating system the power to use special hooks for improved machine execution simulation, thereby making them more compatible with the underlying hardware. The young wizard decided to modify her spells and apply it to these machines.

#### The Impact (Meaning): The Power of Para-virtualization

As the word spread about Para-virtualization's abilities, many sought her out. She was known to improve performance by using hooks for better machine execution simulation. But there was a catch! The guest operating systems had to be modified, which sometimes led to compatibility issues. Despite this, the villagers understood that it was worth the trade-off, as Para-virtualization's magic made their machines more efficient and powerful.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question: Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

#### Point of View: From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing:
- Pause after introducing the problem and before revealing Para-virtualization's magic.
- Ask a question to engage students, such as "Why do we need faster and more efficient machines?"

#### Analogy:
Para-virtualization is like a chef who uses secret spices (hooks) to improve the taste of a dish (machine execution simulation). But sometimes, changing the recipe (modifying guest operating systems) can cause unexpected reactions (compatibility issues).

### Interactive Activities for Para-virtualization
 1. Debate Topic: "Para-virtualization may lead to improved performance through machine execution simulation, but at what cost? Is it worth modifying the guest operating system and risking compatibility issues for potential gains in efficiency?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "In a hypothetical situation where you are tasked with creating a virtual environment for running multiple applications simultaneously on a single machine, would you choose Para-virtualization over other types of virtualization? Consider the trade-offs between performance improvement and compatibility issues when justifying your choice."

## Teaching Module: Full virtualization
 ### 1. The Story
#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a small town called Technologyville, people faced a challenging problem. They needed to run multiple operating systems on their computers at the same time, but they couldn't because each system was as unique and individual as the person who used it. They needed a solution that would allow them to use any operating system without modification, no matter how different they were.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a brilliant inventor named Full Virtualization came up with an idea. He realized that if he could simulate all the hardware of the underlying device and provide a virtual machine, he could create a world where any operating system could run on the virtual machine without modification. This was a groundbreaking concept! It involved creating a virtual environment that mimicked a real computer's hardware, which would allow different operating systems to coexist and function simultaneously.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Full Virtualization's idea was not only innovative but also incredibly useful. By simulating all the hardware of the underlying device and providing a virtual machine, it allowed any operating system to run on that virtual machine without modification. This was significant because it provided greater flexibility and compatibility for users in Technologyville. However, this type of virtualization had its trade-offs. It could have a higher performance overhead compared to other types of virtualization. Still, the benefits far outweighed the drawbacks, as it opened up new possibilities for running different operating systems on the same computer.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter by allowing it to run multiple operating systems without modification?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer facing the challenge of running multiple operating systems on the same hardware, but struggling with compatibility issues.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Pause after introducing the problem and the concept to allow students to absorb the information before continuing the story. Ask questions like "Why do you think they needed a solution?" or "How do you think Full Virtualization's idea could help?"
- **Analogy**: Imagine you have a toy box that can hold different toys, but each toy requires a specific type of box to fit correctly. Full virtualization is like having a magical toy box that can adapt to any toy without modification, allowing you to play with all your toys at the same time.

### Interactive Activities for Full virtualization
 1. Debate Topic: "Full virtualization, with its ability to support a wide range of guest operating systems without modification, is a crucial innovation for modern computing. However, due to its higher performance overhead compared to other types of virtualization, some argue that it may not always be the most efficient choice. In this debate, we will explore whether the benefits of full virtualization outweigh its drawbacks or if alternative forms of virtualization should be prioritized in certain situations."

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a situation where a company needs to create an isolated environment for testing a new, unsupported operating system that may cause compatibility issues with other systems. Given the strengths and weaknesses of full virtualization, should they choose this type of virtualization over others, and what factors would influence their decision?"
