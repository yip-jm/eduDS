## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event):
Once upon a time in the land of Cloudia, there was a small business owner named Alice who decided to move her company's data and operations to the cloud. She signed up with a reputable cloud provider, but soon she realized that securing her data and applications wasn't as simple as she thought.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):
One day, Alice had a meeting with her cloud provider's security expert who explained the concept of "Shared Responsibility Model." He said, "In our cloud environment, the infrastructure providers are responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure, service providers like us are responsible for securing the services we offer, and you are responsible for securing your data and applications."

#### The Impact (Meaning):
This concept was an 'Aha!' moment for Alice. She now understood why her data wasn't as secure as she thought it should be and what she needed to do to protect it. The Shared Responsibility Model ensured that each party took responsibility for their part of the security, leading to a more secure cloud environment. This model allowed Alice to focus on her specific needs while still benefiting from the provider's expertise in securing the infrastructure and services. However, she also learned that misunderstandings or gaps in responsibility could lead to security vulnerabilities.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question**: What if the responsibility for securing data in the cloud was shared between the user and the provider?
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of a business owner moving their operations to the cloud for the first time.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Pause after introducing the Shared Responsibility Model to allow students to absorb the concept. Ask a question like, "Who is responsible for securing the data and applications in the cloud?"
- **Analogy**: Imagine a neighborhood watch program. The security of the entire neighborhood (the cloud infrastructure) is managed by one group (infrastructure providers), while each house owner (user) takes care of their own home's security (data and applications).

### Interactive Activities for Shared Responsibility Model
 1. **Debate Topic**: The Shared Responsibility Model provides an efficient way for users to focus on their unique needs while leveraging the provider's expertise in securing infrastructure and services, but does it come at a risk of creating potential security vulnerabilities due to misunderstandings or gaps in responsibility?

2. **What If** Scenario Question: Imagine a company that has just implemented the Shared Responsibility Model for their cloud-based data storage system. A major cybersecurity attack occurs, causing significant damage. The company realizes that one of the main causes was due to a misunderstanding of the provider's responsibility in securing the infrastructure and services. In this situation, should the company have opted for a different security model, or can they justify their choice by considering the benefits it brings in terms of focusing on their specific needs and benefiting from the provider's expertise?

## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management
 ## 1. The Story

### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in the land of Cyberia, there was a kingdom called Cloudtopia where all the people stored their most valuable treasures - secrets, knowledge, and wealth. One day, a cunning thief named DataSnatcher planned to steal these treasures from the citizens of Cloudtopia. The king realized he needed a powerful shield to protect his people's valuables.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
The king summoned his wise advisor, Mastermind, who was an expert in identity and access management. Mastermind explained that this magical concept would create unique keys for every citizen of Cloudtopia, allowing them to unlock only the treasures they were authorized to see. The kingdom also set up watchtowers that controlled access to these keys, ensuring only trusted subjects could create or modify them.

### The Impact (Meaning)
With Mastermind's guidance, the citizens of Cloudtopia learned how crucial it was to manage their identities and access rights within the kingdom. The concept of identity/access management prevented DataSnatcher from stealing the treasures, as only authorized users could access them. Although the kingdom needed to be vigilant in implementing this system, they knew that doing so would keep their kingdom safe and prosperous.

## 2. Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question**: How can a kingdom protect its valuable treasures without slowing down its citizens?
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of Mastermind, the wise advisor who must save Cloudtopia from the cunning thief DataSnatcher.

## 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Start with a dramatic question to engage students' curiosity, then dive into the definition and key points. Pause after each point for clarification or questions.
- **Analogy**: Imagine a medieval castle with many rooms containing valuable treasures. Each person in the kingdom has a unique key that fits only their assigned room. The castle guards (access control) ensure that only authorized people have keys to specific rooms, keeping the castle secure.

### Interactive Activities for Identity/Access Management
 1. Debate Topic: "While identity/access management is crucial for controlling and monitoring user access to resources, poorly implemented systems can lead to significant security breaches. Is it more beneficial to prioritize strong access controls over potential efficiency or convenience in order to prevent security risks, or should organizations focus on striking a balance between security and usability?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a large corporation that has recently implemented a new identity/access management system. The system is efficient and user-friendly, making it popular among employees. However, a recent audit reveals that the system has multiple vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers. If you are the CEO of this company, would you choose to: (A) maintain the current system for its efficiency and convenience, knowing the risks involved; or (B) invest in a more secure but potentially less efficient system to protect your company's valuable data?"

## Teaching Module: Data Protection Responsibilities in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
In a bustling city, there were three rival pizza shops - Pizza Paradise, Pasta Palace, and Sausage Shack. Each of these restaurants had their own way of making pizzas. Pizza Paradise made the dough and provided the oven but let the customers add their toppings. Pasta Palace made the dough, added a few basic toppings, and left it up to the customers to add any extra toppings they wanted. Sausage Shack was responsible for making the entire pizza, including choosing the toppings. But one day, all three restaurants faced a food poisoning outbreak.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
As investigators tried to trace back the source of the outbreak, they discovered that each restaurant had different rules about who was responsible for ensuring that their pizza ingredients were safe to eat. Pizza Paradise, similar to IaaS, left it up to the customers to make sure their toppings were safe. Pasta Palace, like PaaS, offered basic security in the form of hygienic practices but required customers to follow additional safety measures to keep their pizzas safe. Sausage Shack, akin to SaaS, took care of the entire pizza-making process and was responsible for ensuring that the final product was safe to eat.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Understanding these responsibilities helped investigators determine who should take measures to prevent future outbreaks. Pizza Paradise needed to ensure their customers understood how to safely prepare their own toppings. Pasta Palace had to teach their customers about proper food handling and storage techniques. Sausage Shack was responsible for using only safe ingredients and following strict safety protocols in the kitchen. These different levels of responsibility allowed the restaurants to cater to various customer needs while still maintaining a high level of food safety.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
