## Teaching Module: Orchestration Tools
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine a bustling bee hive, where each bee has a specific job to do and they work in perfect harmony to create honey and maintain the colony. However, one day, the queen bee decides that the hive needs to expand its operations. She sends out scout bees to find new locations for additional hives. These scout bees return with different information about potential locations - some are too small, some are far away, and others have predators lurking around. The worker bees need a way to sort through this information quickly and decide on the best place to expand.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
The worker bees realize they can use their hive's advanced communication system, which allows them to share information with each other instantly. They designate certain bees as "orchestrators" who are in charge of receiving the scout bee messages and using a special algorithm to determine the best location for expansion. The orchestrator bees then relay their decision to the rest of the colony, who quickly begin preparing to move to the new location.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The concept of "Orchestration Tools" is like the communication system and algorithms used by the worker bees in our story. These tools automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, enabling better resource utilization and fault tolerance. By improving resource utilization and fault tolerance, orchestration tools make it easier for developers to build, manage, and scale their applications efficiently.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
