## Teaching Module: Docker
 ## 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time, in a land filled with diverse computer systems, developers faced a massive challenge. They had to deploy their software on different systems, but the process was complex and error-prone. Imagine trying to build a sandcastle on a beach where the sand, waves, and wind were constantly changing!

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
In this land, there lived a wise sage named Docker. Docker was a containerization platform that had the magical ability to package software with all its dependencies into a single container. This way, developers could easily run their software on any system without worrying about the underlying hardware and network. Just like a magician, Docker made it possible for different systems to cooperate seamlessly!

### The Impact (Meaning)
Docker's power came from its ability to remove the need for complex setup processes and make deploying software across different systems a breeze. However, it wasn't perfect. Docker relied on hypervisor-based virtualization, which could have some performance overhead. But in return, it gained attention in High Performance Computing (HPC) applications due to benefits like removing the hypervisor dependency and performance improvements.

## 2. Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question**: Can a single platform make software deployment easier across different systems while maintaining its performance?
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of an engineer facing difficulties in deploying their software across diverse systems.

## 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
### Pacing
Pause after "Docker was a containerization platform that had the magical ability to package software with all its dependencies into a single container." and again after "Docker's power came from its ability to remove the need for complex setup processes and make deploying software across different systems a breeze." to allow students to absorb the information. Ask questions during these pauses, such as "What do you think Docker can do?" and "Why is it important that Docker can package software with all dependencies into a single container?"

### Analogy
Imagine you're going on a trip with a group of friends, each of you carrying different parts of the luggage. Now, imagine if someone packs everything into one suitcase, making it easier to carry and manage. Docker is like that person who packed everything into one suitcase, making software deployment easier across diverse systems.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
 1. Debate Topic: "Docker's strengths of packaging software with all dependencies and running it anywhere are overshadowed by its weaknesses, such as performance overhead due to hypervisor-based virtualization, making it less efficient in comparison to other containerization technologies."

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine you have been tasked with deploying a high-performance, low-latency application across multiple platforms. Considering Docker's strengths and weaknesses, should you choose Docker or explore alternative solutions? Justify your choice."

## Teaching Module: Singularity
 ## The Story

### The Problem (Event)
In the vast universe of computing, researchers and scientists faced an insurmountable challenge. They needed a solution that could bring portability to containers across High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments. They were struggling with hardware and network isolation in their systems, and they needed something specifically designed for HPC fields.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a group of brilliant engineers discovered Singularity, the containerization platform that could solve these problems. Singularity was uniquely focused on portability containers across HPC environments. It achieved process, hardware, and network isolation, making it a perfect fit for the needs of researchers and scientists in the HPC field.

### The Impact (Meaning)
Singularity became a game-changer because it addressed the unique needs of HPC environments. Its portability and ease of use made it a valuable tool for researchers and scientists, allowing them to focus on their work without worrying about containerization issues. However, Singularity was not designed for general-purpose usage, which could be seen as a limitation. Nevertheless, its strengths far outweighed its weaknesses, making it an essential solution for the HPC community.

## Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question**: Can one platform revolutionize containerization in High-Performance Computing environments?
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of a researcher struggling to find a suitable containerization platform for their HPC environment.

## Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Pause after introducing the challenge faced by researchers and scientists, and again after describing Singularity's strengths and weaknesses. This will give students time to process the information and ask questions.
- **Analogy**: Imagine trying to organize a complex puzzle with many different pieces that need to fit together perfectly. Singularity is like the perfect piece of the puzzle, designed specifically for High-Performance Computing environments.

### Interactive Activities for Singularity
 1. Debate Topic: "While the Singularity has demonstrated remarkable performance in High Performance Computing environments, should it be considered as a general-purpose solution, or is its specialized focus its greatest strength?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a world where the Singularity is the dominant computing platform used by all industries. How would this impact the advancement of technology, and what might be some potential drawbacks of having a singular, highly-specialized solution across various fields?"

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event)
In the land of computer science, there was a great challenge. Developers needed to run multiple applications on a single machine, but they also wanted to keep those applications isolated from each other and from the host system. This way, if one application had a problem or caused an error, it wouldn't affect the others. But, the traditional methods of doing this were heavy and consumed a lot of resources.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a brilliant idea came to life. It was called Linux Containers, or LXC for short. This containerization platform used the Linux kernel's features to create isolated user-space instances. It implemented a method of achieving hardware and network isolation, and contributed to the development and widespread of container-based virtualization mechanisms. With this approach, it achieved a lightweight version of hypervisor-based virtualization.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Linux Containers were important because they provided a lightweight alternative to traditional hypervisor-based virtualization. They reduced performance overhead and resource consumption, making them perfect for situations where resources were limited or needed to be conserved. LXC's strengths included its ability to share resources with the host machine and avoid some hardware penalties. However, it was not specifically designed for HPC (High Performance Computing) environments.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question
Could a simple container change the way we think about virtualization forever?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an overworked system administrator trying to manage multiple applications on one machine without causing chaos.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Pause after introducing the challenge, before revealing the concept, and again after explaining how it works. This will help students absorb the information and keep them engaged.
- **Analogy**: Think of Linux Containers as separate rooms in a house. Each room has its own decorations and furniture, but they all share the same walls and foundation of the house. The rooms are isolated from each other, so if one gets messy, it doesn't affect the others or the rest of the house.

### Interactive Activities for Linux Containers (LXC)
 1. **Debate Topic**: "While Linux Containers (LXC) offer resource sharing advantages with the host machine and avoid certain hardware penalties, they are not specifically designed for high performance computing environments. Should LXC be considered a viable option for HPC applications, or should we look towards alternatives that are more suited to this purpose?"

2. **What If' Scenario Question**: "Imagine you are tasked with setting up a high-performance computing (HPC) environment for scientific research on climate modeling. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of Linux Containers (LXC), would you choose LXC or an alternative like Docker for your HPC setup? Justify your choice based on how well it aligns with the requirements of the project, taking into account factors such as resource sharing, hardware penalties, and overall performance."
