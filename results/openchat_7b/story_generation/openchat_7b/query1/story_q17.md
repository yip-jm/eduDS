## Teaching Module: Cloud-Native
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a bustling tech city, there was a rapidly growing startup called `EpicTech`. As their user base expanded, so did the complexity of their systems. They found it increasingly difficult to manage their services and struggled to scale their infrastructure efficiently. The company's engineers were working round the clock, trying to keep up with the demand.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a team of `EpicTech` engineers stumbled upon an innovative concept called "Cloud-Native." They learned that it was an amalgamation of best practices from companies like Netflix, Twitter, Alibaba, Uber, and Facebook. The key points they discovered were:

1. It included continuous deployment, containers, and microservices.
2. It aimed to achieve elastic scaling capabilities, speed of introducing new functionality, and increased automation.
3. Practices were used by companies like Netflix and Uber.

They realized that by adopting these practices, they could build a sustainable ecosystem around high-quality projects orchestrating containers as part of a microservices architecture. This would help them scale their infrastructure efficiently while ensuring seamless service for their users.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
By implementing Cloud-Native, `EpicTech` found that it promoted the growth of their ecosystem, encouraged collaboration among their engineers, and supported open source technologies. This approach allowed them to build a more sustainable and scalable system, which ultimately led to faster innovation and better user experiences. However, they also acknowledged that there might be trade-offs or weaknesses in relying solely on this concept, such as potential security vulnerabilities or the need for specialized expertise. Nonetheless, Cloud-Native proved to be an essential tool in their journey towards success.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question**: Can a company thrive if it can't keep up with its rapidly growing user base?
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of an overwhelmed engineer at `EpicTech`.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Pause after introducing the problem to let students empathize with the situation, and again after discussing the 'Aha!' moment to emphasize its impact on the company.
- **Analogy**: Imagine a bakery that can't keep up with the increasing number of orders because it uses outdated tools and methods. The Cloud-Native concept is like introducing modern machinery and efficient processes to streamline operations, allowing the bakery to meet the growing demand without compromising on quality.

### Interactive Activities for Cloud-Native
 1. **Debate Topic**: "While cloud-native technologies offer significant benefits in terms of ecosystem growth, collaboration, and open source support, these advantages may come at the cost of potential security risks and vendor lock-in. Are these benefits worth the potential drawbacks?"

2. **What If' Scenario Question**: "Imagine a world where all software development is solely focused on cloud-native technologies. Discuss how this could impact the pace of innovation, collaboration among developers, and the role of open source in the tech industry. Additionally, consider any possible negative consequences that may arise from such a scenario."

## Teaching Module: CNCF
 ## The Story

### 1. The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in the land of technology, there was a growing need for a more efficient way to manage computer systems and applications. As companies began to adopt cloud-based services, they found themselves struggling with the complexities of orchestrating containers and managing microservices architectures.

### 2. The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a group of visionaries came together and created an organization called the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, or CNCF for short. This foundation aimed to build sustainable ecosystems and foster a community around a constellation of high-quality projects that orchestrated containers as part of a microservices architecture.

Within this new foundation, they defined a CloudNative reference Architecture with four layers: infrastructure, provisioning, runtime, and orchestration. They worked tirelessly to promote the growth of the ecosystem, support open source projects, and make the open source community thrive.

### 3. The Impact (Meaning)
The CNCF played a crucial role in the open source community by fostering growth, promoting technologies, and making the ecosystem thrive. By encouraging collaboration, supporting open source projects, and helping build sustainable ecosystems, CNCF made a significant impact on the way companies managed their cloud-based services.

## Storytelling Hooks

### Dramatic Question
What if there was an organization that could revolutionize how we manage cloud-based services by creating a sustainable ecosystem for container orchestration and microservices?

### Point of View
Imagine being an engineer tasked with managing complex container orchestrations and microservices architectures. How would your life change if there was an organization like the CNCF that could provide guidance, support, and community involvement to simplify these challenges?

## Classroom Delivery Tips

### Pacing
- Pause after introducing the challenge faced by engineers in managing cloud-based services.
- Pause after mentioning the creation of the CNCF and its goals.
- Pause again when discussing the importance of the CNCF and how it impacts the open source community.

### Analogy
Think of the CNCF as a garden center that provides seeds, plants, and resources to create and maintain beautiful gardens. By offering a variety of high-quality projects and support for container orchestration and microservices, CNCF helps engineers grow healthy, efficient cloud-based services.

### Interactive Activities for CNCF
 1. Debate Topic: "CNCF encourages collaboration and supports open source projects, but does this come at the cost of creating monopolies in the technology industry?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a world where CNCF no longer supported open source projects. How would this impact the sustainability of the tech ecosystem, and what alternative strategies could be implemented to maintain collaboration while addressing potential drawbacks?"
