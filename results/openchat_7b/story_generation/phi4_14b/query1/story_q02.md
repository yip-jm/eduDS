# Story Module: Operating System Level Virtualisation

## 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

### The Problem (Event)
In a bustling city, there was an office building with just one large conference room, but many teams needed to use it simultaneously. Each team wanted to conduct their own meetings without interruptions from others. However, the shared space led to constant scheduling conflicts and inefficiencies. Teams had to wait for their turn or work at odd hours, causing frustration and decreased productivity.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, an ingenious engineer named Alex visited the building. Observing the chaos, Alex proposed a clever solution: "What if we could create separate virtual conference rooms within this single space?" Using advanced technology, Alex demonstrated how each team could have its own isolated environment. By implementing isolation mechanisms similar to those in operating system level virtualisation, each team's meeting felt like they had their own dedicated room.

Alex explained that just as the virtual environments needed a set of hooks to improve execution simulation, the teams' meetings required specific arrangements and rules. This allowed multiple sessions to occur simultaneously without interference, maximizing the use of the shared conference room.

### The Impact (Meaning)
The impact was transformative. Teams could now conduct their meetings seamlessly at any time, boosting productivity and satisfaction. This method improved security by ensuring that one team's activities didn't affect another's. However, Alex noted a trade-off: setting up these virtual rooms required some initial adjustments to the existing system, akin to modifying guest operating systems for compatibility.

Operating system level virtualisation matters because it allows efficient resource utilization and enhanced user experience without compromising on isolation and security. Despite the need for modifications, the benefits of increased efficiency and better resource management were undeniable.

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualization
## The Story: Para-virtualization

### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in the bustling world of computing, there was a grand orchestra called "The Virtual Machines." Each musician—representing an operating system—played their part harmoniously, but they were all trying to perform on a single stage with limited space and resources. This caused delays, conflicts, and inefficiencies as each musician attempted to adapt to the shared platform without truly understanding its nuances.

In this scenario, virtual machines had to mimic real hardware using emulation. However, this created a bottleneck because every command executed by the guest operating system needed translation through layers of software before reaching the actual hardware. The result was slow performance and high overhead—a challenge that left many in search of a more efficient solution.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, an innovative engineer named Alex pondered: "What if we could make these musicians smarter by giving them special tools to understand the stage better?" This led to the discovery of **Para-virtualization**. In this approach, instead of trying to emulate everything perfectly, Alex introduced a set of hooks—specialized interfaces that allowed each guest operating system to interact directly with the stage's infrastructure.

By modifying the operating systems to use these hooks, they could bypass some layers of translation and communicate more efficiently with the hardware. This transformation was enabled by a Type1 Hypervisor—a master conductor overseeing everything at the hardware level—which facilitated direct communication between the modified operating systems and the underlying machinery.

### The Impact (Meaning)
The impact of this innovation was profound. Para-virtualization allowed each guest operating system to perform its tasks more efficiently, reducing performance overhead significantly. This improved compatibility with the underlying hardware meant smoother performances, faster execution, and a reduction in resource wastage.

However, there were trade-offs. Each musician—or operating system—needed special training (modification) to understand how to use these hooks effectively. This introduced potential compatibility issues, as not all musicians could be retrained easily or at all. Despite this challenge, the benefits of enhanced performance and efficiency made para-virtualization a game-changer in the world of virtualization.

## Storytelling Hooks

- **Dramatic Question**: "Could giving computers special tools make them perform better together?"
  
- **Point of View**: "From the perspective of an engineer facing the challenge of making multiple operating systems work efficiently on limited hardware."

## Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**:
  - Pause after introducing the problem to let students imagine the inefficiencies in a crowded system.
  - Ask, "Can anyone think of why this might cause delays?" before revealing the 'Aha!' moment.
  - After explaining para-virtualization, pause and ask, "How do you think these hooks improve performance?"

- **Analogy**:
  - Imagine virtual machines as musicians in an orchestra. Without special tools (hooks), they struggle to perform efficiently on a shared stage. With these tools, each musician can play their part more smoothly and effectively, just like how para-virtualization allows operating systems to interact directly with the hardware for better performance.

By using this story framework, teachers can engage students with a vivid narrative that illustrates the concept of para-virtualization in an accessible and memorable way.

### Interactive Activities for Para-virtualization
