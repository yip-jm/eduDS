## Teaching Module: Division of security responsibilities
## 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in the bustling city of Cloudville, businesses and individuals were rapidly adopting cloud technology to store their data. This new era promised efficiency and scalability but also introduced significant challenges. Each company, from tech giants to small startups, faced the daunting task of securing vast amounts of sensitive information online.

However, there was confusion about who should secure what. Some believed that once they uploaded their data into the cloud, the cloud provider would handle all security matters. Others assumed it was entirely their responsibility. This miscommunication led to vulnerabilities in the system, with businesses experiencing data breaches and loss of trust from customers. It was clear something needed to change.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
In this time of uncertainty, a wise technologist named Ada gathered the leaders of Cloudville's businesses for an enlightening discussion. She introduced them to a powerful concept: the "Division of Security Responsibilities." 

Ada explained that security in the cloud was not solely the burden of one party but a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the user. This division depended on the type of service they were using:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** The cloud provider would secure the underlying infrastructure, such as servers and data centers. However, users like businesses were responsible for securing their operating system, platform, and applications.
  
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Here, providers secured both the infrastructure and the platform. Users focused on safeguarding their application layer.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** In this model, the provider was in charge of securing everything—infrastructure, platform, and application layers.

Ada's explanation illuminated how each party had specific roles to play, ensuring comprehensive security coverage.

### The Impact (Meaning)
With Ada’s guidance, Cloudville businesses began implementing these shared responsibilities. This new approach brought significant improvements: data breaches reduced dramatically, and trust in cloud technology soared. 

The strengths of this model were evident—by sharing responsibility, both providers and users had a vested interest in securing their assets, leading to a more robust security environment. However, Ada also cautioned that clear communication was crucial; any miscommunication could create gaps in security.

This division of responsibilities ensured everyone contributed to the security ecosystem, making Cloudville not only a tech hub but also a beacon of data protection excellence.
