## Teaching Module: Operating system level virtualisation
### 1. The Story

**The Problem:**

Imagine a bustling city where each person has their own apartment but wants to run their own business without disturbing others. Before operating system level virtualisation, this was a huge issue. Each "apartment" (virtual machine) would need its own physical space (dedicated hardware), leading to a lot of unused or underutilized space, just like having many empty apartments because each person needs their separate living and business area.

**The 'Aha!' Moment:**

One day, an ingenious architect discovered the concept of building a skyscraper with a *unique* setup. This building, much like an operating system, could house multiple "apartments" (virtual machines) isolated from each other, but sharing the same physical space. The trick was to install special "doors" (hooks) that allowed each apartment's occupants to control their environment without affecting others. This way, each person can run their business smoothly, just like having a dedicated server.

**The Impact:**

This approach is a game-changer! It allows *multiple* people to use the *same* building, making the city much more efficient and saving a lot of space. Similarly, operating system level virtualisation lets multiple users or applications run on the same hardware, significantly increasing resource efficiency and allowing for better security since each "apartment" is isolated from the others. However, there's a catch: just like every innovative solution, modifying the building (guest operating system) to install these special doors can be tricky, and might not always work perfectly with every kind of business (every software). 

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:**  
*"Could making a computer 'dumber' by dividing it into multiple virtual machines actually make it smarter in how it uses its resources?"*

**Point of View:**  
*From the perspective of an engineer facing the challenge of maximizing the usage of limited server resources.*

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing:**  
- **Pause at**: "Imagine a bustling city..." to grab students' attention and set the scene.  
- **Ask a question**: After "before operating system level virtualisation," ask, "What do you think was the problem?"

**Analogy:**  
*Relate it to a shared apartment building with soundproof rooms (virtual machines), where each tenant can have their own activities without disturbing others.*  
*"Just like in our city example, an operating system level virtualisation lets different software 'tenants' live in harmony on the same computer hardware, each with its 'soundproof room' for isolation."*

### Interactive Activities for Operating system level virtualisation
### Debate Topic:

**Should the potential security benefits of operating system level virtualisation outweigh its compatibility drawbacks for most organizations?**

### What If Scenario Question:

Imagine a school district wants to implement operating system level virtualization in its computer labs to secure student work environments. However, they are concerned about possible compatibility issues with existing software used in classrooms. **What if** the school district decides to switch entirely to virtualized environments, even though it might require modifications to some educational software? How would this decision impact student learning and IT support, and would the security benefits justify these changes?

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualization
### 1. The Story

**The Problem:** In the bustling world of computer engineering, there was a significant challenge that plagued system designers: *how to efficiently run multiple operating systems on a single machine without sacrificing performance*. Each guest operating system would demand resources as if it were the only one on the hardware, leading to inefficiencies and unnecessary strain on the host machine.

**The 'Aha!' Moment:** One day, an ingenious idea emerged from the depths of virtualization research. This concept was *para-virtualization*, which introduced a groundbreaking approach where the guest operating system was no longer oblivious to its virtual nature. Instead, it was designed to collaborate with the hypervisor through **hooks**—specific points of interaction that allowed for optimized machine execution simulation. This collaborative effort between the guest OS and the Type 1 hypervisor (the master controller of virtual machines) was a *lightbulb moment* that promised to transform virtualization technology.

**The Impact:** The significance of para-virtualization lies in its ability to improve performance by reducing the overhead typically associated with simulating hardware. This method allows guest operating systems to be more compatible with the underlying hardware, making them operate more efficiently. **While this solution demands modification of the guest OS, it is a trade-off worth taking for the substantial performance improvements** it offers. However, this comes with potential *compatibility issues*, as modifications to the guest OS may not always mesh seamlessly with newer updates or different hardware environments.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

**Point of View:** From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in balancing resource allocation across multiple operating systems, para-virtualization became a beacon of hope.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing:** Pause after introducing the problem to let students ponder on the inefficiency before revealing the solution. Highlight the 'Aha!' moment with enthusiasm to captivate their interest.

**Analogy:** Compare para-virtualization to a partnership between a traveler (guest OS) and a local guide (Type 1 hypervisor). The traveler doesn't need to know every detail about the terrain but can rely on the guide for the most efficient route, achieving the journey's goal faster and with less strain. This analogy underscores the efficiency gains of para-virtualization without delving into complex technical details.

### Interactive Activities for Para-virtualization
### Debate Topic

**Resolved: The benefits of para-virtualization in terms of performance enhancement outweigh its drawback of requiring modified guest operating systems.**

### What If Scenario Question

**Imagine you are a system administrator tasked with setting up a new virtualized environment for a diverse range of applications, each running on different operating systems. Would you opt for para-virtualization to potentially achieve better performance, even if it means modifying the guest operating systems? Justify your choice by considering the strengths (improved performance through machine execution simulation) and weaknesses (compatibility issues due to modified guest OS).**

## Teaching Module: Full virtualization
### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Before the advent of full virtualization, computer systems were tightly coupled with their physical hardware. This created a significant challenge for software developers and system administrators. They faced the problem of **operating system incompatibility** and **limited flexibility**. Systems could only truly operate on the hardware they were initially designed for, limiting the mobility and versatility of software applications.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Imagine an engineer grappling with this issue one day. Through extensive research and experimentation, they discover **full virtualization**, a technique that promises to simulate any hardware environment within a virtual machine. This realization comes with the understanding that by providing a virtual representation of real hardware, full virtualization allows **any operating system** to run seamlessly on top of this simulated environment without requiring modifications.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: The impact of this discovery is profound. Full virtualization solves the problem of OS compatibility and provides **greater flexibility** in deploying applications across different hardware platforms. This concept *matters* because it democratizes access to computing resources, enabling businesses and individuals to run a wider variety of software without being locked into specific hardware configurations. However, it's important to note that while full virtualization offers these benefits, it might come with a **performance overhead** compared to other forms of virtualization.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**: "Could creating a digital mirror of our hardware revolutionize how we think about software development and deployment?"

**Point of View**: Consider telling the story from the perspective of an engineer who has just had the 'Aha!' moment about full virtualization. This viewpoint not only personalizes the discovery but also brings the reader into the mindset of someone navigating the complexities of computing.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing**: When explaining full virtualization, start with the **problem** to engage the students' curiosity. Then, take a moment to let this sink in before revealing the **solution** and the engineer's **'Aha!' moment**. Finally, discuss the **impact** at length, pausing to ask students how they think this solution affects the software development and deployment landscape.

**Analogy**: Compare full virtualization to renting a movie versus buying a physical copy. When you rent a movie (full virtualization), you can watch it on any device that has the capability to play it (any virtual machine), similar to how any operating system can run on virtualized hardware. In contrast, buying a physical copy (bare metal installation) is like being locked into one specific player or device. This analogy helps students grasp the concept in a relatable context.

### Interactive Activities for Full virtualization
