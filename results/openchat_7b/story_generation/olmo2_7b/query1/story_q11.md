## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management
### 1. The Story

**The Problem**

Once upon a time, in the bustling town of Techville, there was a computer whiz named Alex who ran a small online bookstore. One day, Alex discovered that someone had been accessing his customers' data without permission and stealing their personal information. This unauthorized access caused panic among his customers, and Alex faced legal consequences due to the breach.

**The 'Aha!' Moment**

Feeling devastated but determined to fix the situation, Alex delved into the world of **Identity/Access Management**. He learned that managing user identities and their access rights within a system is like being a doorman at a fancy club. The doorman checks everyone’s ID before letting them in, ensuring that only authorized guests enter. Similarly, Alex realized that by implementing identity management, he could create unique IDs for each customer and set specific access rights for their data.

**The Impact**

After applying these principles, Alex’s bookstore became impenetrable to unauthorized users. Identity/access management provided him with a way to control and monitor user access to resources, ensuring that only those who were supposed to could view sensitive customer information. This not only secured his business but also built trust with his customers again.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**

"Could managing who has access to data be the key to safeguarding Techville's digital secrets?"

**Point of View**

From Alex’s perspective, we see the transformation from a vulnerable entrepreneur to a tech-savvy guardian of his customers' information.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing**

Pause after each section to allow students to process the information and reflect on the story's implications.

**Analogy**

To help students grasp the concept, compare identity/access management to a library: just as a librarian checks IDs to let only the book borrowers access the books, a computer system with identity/access management allows only authorized users to view specific data.

By using this structured narrative, teachers can engage their students in understanding the critical concept of identity/access management in an accessible and memorable way.

### Interactive Activities for Identity/Access Management
