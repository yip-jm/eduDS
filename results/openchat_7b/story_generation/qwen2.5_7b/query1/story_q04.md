## Teaching Module: Docker
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine you are an engineer working on a high-performance computing project. You have developed a sophisticated application that relies on numerous complex dependencies and specific configurations. However, every time you want to deploy this application to a new environment—be it a different machine or even the same machine with updated software—you face a daunting task of setting up all these dependencies and ensuring they are compatible. This setup process can be slow, error-prone, and inconsistent across environments. Your team is frustrated because the development and testing cycles are lengthy, and maintaining compatibility becomes a significant challenge.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, you come across Docker. You learn that it's a containerization platform designed to package software with all its dependencies into a single unit called a "container." These containers can then run on any system without needing the same setup and configuration as traditional applications. It turns out, Docker is not just about making deployment easier; it's about removing hypervisor dependency and achieving process hardware and network isolation, which significantly boosts performance.

Docker works by creating an isolated environment where your application runs with all its necessary dependencies bundled together. This means that the container can run on any system without worrying about missing dependencies or conflicts with other software running on the same machine. The key points are:

- **Needed for Hypervisor-based virtualization**: Docker doesn't require a hypervisor, which can reduce performance overhead.
- **Gained attention in HPC applications due to benefits like removing hypervisor dependency and performance improvements**: Docker's lightweight nature makes it ideal for high-performance computing environments where speed and resource efficiency matter.
- **Achieves process hardware and network isolation**: Each container operates independently, ensuring that the application runs consistently without interference from other processes.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Docker is important because it allows for easy deployment of software across different systems, reducing the need for complex setup processes. It can significantly speed up development cycles by enabling developers to focus on coding rather than managing dependencies and system configurations. However, there are trade-offs to consider:

- **Strengths**: Docker's ability to package software with all dependencies and run on any system makes it incredibly versatile.
- **Weaknesses**: While Docker reduces the need for a hypervisor, this can introduce performance overhead if not managed correctly.

### Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter? In the world of software development, sometimes stripping down an environment can lead to more reliable and consistent deployments. How does Docker help achieve that?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: After introducing the problem, take a moment to pause and ask the class if they have ever faced similar issues with software deployment.
- **Analogy**: Think of Docker as packing your lunch for school. Just like you include everything you need—your sandwich, fruit, napkin—in one convenient bag, Docker includes all the necessary components of an application in a single container that can run anywhere. This makes it easier to manage and ensures that everyone gets the same meal every day.
- **Engagement**: Ask students if they have ever tried to install software on different machines and faced compatibility issues. Relate this back to how Docker solves these problems by bundling everything together.
- **Summary Pause**: Before concluding, briefly recap why Docker is beneficial but also mention its limitations, ensuring a balanced view of the technology.

By structuring the story in this way, you can make the concept of Docker engaging and easy to understand for your students.

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
In the vast world of computing, there has always been a balance between achieving isolated environments and minimizing resource consumption. Developers often faced challenges where they needed to run multiple applications on a single machine but had concerns about performance overhead and resource management—similar to trying to fit too many people in a small room without enough space.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, an engineer was facing the same problem while working with Linux. They realized that instead of creating full virtual machines (VMs) for each application, which were heavy and resource-intensive like setting up multiple, fully-equipped houses in one garden, a better solution could be found. This is where **Linux Containers (LXC)** came to their rescue.

**Definition**: LXC is a containerization platform that uses Linux kernel features to create isolated user-space instances. 

**Key Points**: 
1. **Isolation**: It implements methods of achieving process hardware and network isolation, ensuring each container operates independently.
2. **Lightweight Virtualization**: LXC contributes to the development and widespread use of container-based virtualization mechanisms, providing a lightweight version of hypervisor-based virtualization.

Imagine having a small, flexible tent that can be set up anywhere in your backyard without disturbing the rest of your garden. Each tent represents an isolated environment where applications can run freely while sharing the same resources as the host machine, much like how a container shares the host's network and storage but has its own file system and processes.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
This 'aha' moment led to a significant impact in the tech world. LXC provided developers with a smarter solution by reducing performance overhead and resource consumption—like making each tent in your garden both self-sufficient yet shareable, thus optimizing space and resources. Its strengths include sharing host resources efficiently and avoiding hardware penalties, while its limitations lie in areas like high-performance computing (HPC) environments where specific resource management is crucial.
