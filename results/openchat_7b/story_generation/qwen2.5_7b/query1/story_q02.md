## Teaching Module: Operating system level virtualisation
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine a bustling server room filled with servers, each humming quietly but consuming precious space and energy. Each server is like a dedicated workspace, isolated from others, which can be inefficient when you consider that many of these workstations run at less than full capacity. This scenario represents the challenge faced by IT managers: how to make better use of physical resources without compromising on security or performance.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a brilliant engineer named Alex had an epiphany. What if they could take this dedicated workspace concept and apply it in such a way that multiple users could share the same hardware but still have their own isolated environment? This idea led to the discovery of operating system level virtualisation. According to its definition, "Operating system level virtualisation uses isolation mechanisms to provide users with virtual environments similar to a dedicated server." Essentially, Alex realized that by modifying the guest operating systems (the software running on top) and using hooks to simulate machine execution more efficiently, they could create multiple isolated user spaces from just one piece of hardware.

Key Points:
- **Isolates Users in Virtual Environments Similar to a Dedicated Server**: Just as each server offers its own environment, this virtualisation technique ensures that users can work without interfering with others.
- **Requires the Guest Operating System to be Modified**: To make these virtual environments work smoothly, the operating system needs to be altered to use specific hooks. This modification allows for better performance and isolation.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The impact of this solution is profound. By implementing OS level virtualisation, multiple users can now run their own isolated environments on a single piece of hardware, significantly increasing resource utilization and efficiency. For example, if each server consumed 100 watts of power and was running at only 20% capacity, replacing four such servers with one using this technique could save a substantial amount of energy and reduce the overall space needed in the data center.

Strengths:
- **Improves Security**: Isolating user environments means that if something goes wrong in one virtual environment, it doesnâ€™t affect others. This can be crucial for maintaining overall system security.
- **Increases Resource Utilization and Efficiency**: By sharing hardware resources among multiple users, fewer physical servers are needed, leading to cost savings and reduced environmental impact.

Weaknesses:
- **Compatibility Issues**: Modifying the guest operating system may introduce compatibility issues that need careful management. Ensuring all software works seamlessly in this new setup can be a challenge.

### Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge, imagine being tasked with optimizing resource usage while maintaining security and performance. How would you approach such a complex problem?

### Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Pause after describing the initial problem to ensure students understand the inefficiencies in current server utilization.
- **Analogy**: Use the analogy of sharing a classroom where each student has their own desk but all share the same room and resources. This helps explain how multiple users can benefit from one piece of hardware without interference.

By weaving this story into your lesson, you can engage students with a relatable narrative that illustrates both the problem and solution in an accessible way.

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualization
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

**The Problem (Event)**: Imagine a scenario in a bustling city where multiple cars are trying to share the same road without any traffic management system. Each car is like an operating system running on physical hardware, but with no communication or coordination among them. This leads to inefficiencies and potential collisions, which can be likened to performance overheads and compatibility issues when multiple virtual machines run on a single physical machine.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: One day, a brilliant traffic engineer devises a clever solution by introducing a set of special signals that each car must follow. These signals help the cars communicate with each other more efficiently, reducing congestion and improving overall flow. In the world of virtualization, this is akin to para-virtualization. The guest operating systems (our 'cars') are modified to use hooks (these 'special signals'), which enable them to better simulate machine execution without the need for direct hardware access from a Type1 Hypervisor (the traffic engineer's system). This way, the guest OS can work more closely with the underlying hardware, reducing performance overhead and improving compatibility.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Para-virtualization is important because it allows guest operating systems to be more compatible with the underlying hardware, which in turn reduces performance overhead. The strengths of this approach include improved performance through efficient use of hooks for machine execution simulation. However, a potential weakness is that the guest OS needs to be modified, which might introduce compatibility issues or require additional effort from developers and system administrators.
