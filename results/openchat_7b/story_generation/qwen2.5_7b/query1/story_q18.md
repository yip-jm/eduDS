The concept of cloud-native is an amalgamation of best practices from tech giants like Netflix, Twitter, Alibaba, Uber, and Facebook. It involves using continuous deployment, containers, and microservices. Continuous deployment means that updates can be made quickly and automatically without human intervention. Containers allow you to package applications into lightweight, portable units so they can run consistently across different environments. Microservices break down your application into small, manageable services that can operate independently.

With cloud-native architecture, Netflix was able to achieve elastic scaling capabilities—meaning their systems could dynamically adjust resources based on demand. This helped them handle sudden spikes in traffic without downtime or performance issues. They also introduced new features faster and automated many tasks, reducing the need for manual intervention.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Cloud-native doesn't just solve the problem; it transforms how you approach application development. It allows for better scalability by ensuring your system can grow with demand, making it easier to handle surges in traffic without additional infrastructure costs. Faster feature introduction means that you can quickly adapt to customer needs and market trends, giving your business a competitive edge. Increased automation helps reduce operational overhead, allowing your team to focus on innovation rather than routine tasks.

## Teaching Module: Microservices
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine you are building an application that is like a bustling city. This city has different neighborhoods: one for housing, another for shopping, and a third for entertainment. Each neighborhood has its own distinct needs and services, but they all need to work together seamlessly. Now, what happens when the city grows exponentially in size? The current architecture might struggle with managing such complexity. This is where our problem lies.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a group of clever engineers came up with an innovative solution: instead of trying to manage one massive and complex application, they decided to break it down into smaller, manageable parts—like dividing the city into neighborhoods. Each neighborhood would run its own processes and communicate through well-defined APIs. These neighborhoods are called microservices.

Each microservice runs in its own process and communicates with other services via a network API. For example:
- The housing service manages the allocation of resources.
- The shopping service handles transactions and inventory management.
- The entertainment service oversees fun activities and events.

These microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, much like how different neighborhoods in our city can operate autonomously while still contributing to the overall functioning of the city.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
This discovery has transformed the way we build applications. Microservices improve flexibility by allowing each part of an application to evolve independently without disrupting others. They enhance maintainability because issues are isolated and easier to fix. And, they significantly boost scalability since services can be scaled up or down based on demand.

## Teaching Module: Orchestration Tools
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine a bustling city square filled with vendors and performers. Each vendor has their own booth, each set up to showcase different goods or services. Some booths are large, some small, but they all operate independently of one another. Now, picture this scenario in the context of running applications on multiple servers. Just like the vendors need to manage their space, resources, and coordination with others, a team managing several containerized applications faces similar challenges. Deploying new versions, scaling up or down based on demand, and ensuring that everything runs smoothly without any disruptions—this is where things can get complicated.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, an innovative engineer named Alex was tasked with improving the efficiency of their application deployment process. Every time there was a change to the code, it required manual updates across several servers, leading to delays and potential errors. This inefficiency was like having multiple vendors in our city square trying to manage their booths independently without any coordination—inefficient and error-prone.

Then one day, Alex discovered orchestration tools. These are like a master controller for all the vendors' booths. With orchestration tools such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, these tools can automatically deploy applications across multiple servers (or 'booths'), scale them based on demand, and even handle failures gracefully—ensuring that if one vendor's booth goes down, another steps in to take its place.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Orchestration tools are a game changer because they automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. By doing so, these tools enable better resource utilization and fault tolerance, just like how a well-coordinated city square can handle more vendors without chaos. However, while these tools bring significant benefits, it’s important to consider their limitations. For instance, while they streamline the process, they might require additional setup and maintenance.
