## Teaching Module: Monolithic architecture
## Teaching Story: Monolithic Architecture

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the early days of computing, applications were monolithic – single programs handling all functionalities like word processing, email, and games. As software grew more complex, these monoliths became cumbersome and inefficient.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter the service-oriented architecture (SOA) revolution. Developers realized that splitting applications into smaller, modular services would enable greater flexibility, scalability, and reusability. But what about the existing monoliths?

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Monolithic architectures lack the modularity of SOA. While they work well for smaller projects, larger applications suffer from tight coupling, limiting scalability and adaptability. While monolithic architectures offer a simpler development process, they can become bottlenecks as applications grow.


### 2. Storytelling Hooks

## Storytelling Module: Statelessness

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the bustling city of Serviceville, where countless digital denizens interacted, there was a growing problem. Clients often arrived with incomplete information, leading to confusion and inefficiency. Every time, they had to start from scratch, regardless of their previous interactions.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: One day, a wise old architect, while pondering the woes of Serviceville, had an 'aha!' moment. He realized that the solution lay in statelessness – a property where services remember nothing of past interactions. This way, clients could approach any service at any time without worrying about its prior state.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Statelessness revolutionized Serviceville. Clients could seamlessly interact with any service, regardless of their history. This enabled scalability and maintainability, as adding or removing services had no impact on existing clients.
