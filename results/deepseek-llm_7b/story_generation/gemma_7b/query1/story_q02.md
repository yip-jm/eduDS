## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
## Storytelling Module: Full Virtualisation

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Data centres were bursting with physical servers, each running a single application. This inefficient setup led to high costs, limited scalability, and poor resource utilization.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Full Virtualisation! Inspired by the concept of emulating hardware, engineers realized they could create a virtual machine that mimics the behaviour of an entire physical server. This meant running multiple operating systems on a single physical server.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Full virtualization transformed data centres. By efficiently sharing hardware resources, it increased resource utilization, flexibility, and workload compatibility. However, this came with a trade-off: additional layers of abstraction could slightly impact performance.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: "Can we make computers smarter by making them dumber?"
* **Point of View**: "From the perspective of a data centre manager seeking to optimize costs and performance."

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, building from physical servers to virtualisation. Pause after the 'Aha!' moment to allow students to grasp the concept.
* **Analogy**: "Imagine a physical server as a complex machine with many moving parts. Full virtualization is like creating a detailed blueprint of that machine, allowing you to build a virtual machine that behaves almost identically."

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
## Debate Topic:

**Is the increased flexibility and resource utilization of Full Virtualisation worth the potential performance trade-offs?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a scenario where a school district needs to rapidly scale up their virtual learning infrastructure to accommodate an unexpected surge in student enrollment. How would you leverage the strengths of Full Virtualisation while mitigating its potential performance limitations in this context?**

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
## 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the enterprise environment, virtual machines were experiencing performance bottlenecks due to the abstraction layer between the guest OS and hardware resources. Drivers weren't playing nicely, leading to sluggish operation.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter para-virtualisation. This innovative technique required modifying the guest OS to install specific hooks, enhancing machine execution simulation. By interacting directly with hardware resources, para-virtualisation achieved better compatibility with native drivers, overcoming the performance limitations of traditional virtualisation.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Para-virtualisation ushered in a new era of efficient resource utilization in virtualized environments. Its ability to seamlessly integrate with hardware drivers resulted in improved performance, scalability, and compatibility. While demanding modification of the guest OS, the benefits proved invaluable in enterprise setups, where seamless interaction with physical hardware is crucial.


## 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**: Can we make a computer dumber to make it smarter?

**Point of View**: Imagine you're an engineer tasked with maximizing the performance of a virtual machine in a large corporate network.


## 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, focusing on the challenges of traditional virtualisation. Then, present para-virtualisation as the solution, emphasizing its interaction with hardware drivers. Finally, discuss the trade-offs involved.

**Analogy**: Think of para-virtualisation like a translator between the guest OS and hardware. The translator (para-virtualisation) understands both languages (guest OS and hardware) and facilitates seamless communication, improving performance.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
## Debate Topic:

**Is para-virtualisation a superior approach to full virtualisation despite its requirement for guest OS modification?**

## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine you are tasked with deploying a new application that requires high performance. Would you prioritize compatibility with existing hardware or prioritize the isolation offered by full virtualization? Explain your reasoning based on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.**

## Teaching Module: Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
## Storytelling Module: Hardware-Supported Virtualisation

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In large enterprises, multiple teams often require access to the same physical servers, leading to conflicts when everyone wants to run their own operating systems. Traditional virtualization was limited in its ability to handle this demand.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Hardware-Supported Virtualisation. This innovative approach simulates the entire hypervisor, enabling multiple operating systems to coexist seamlessly on the same server. It's like creating a virtual clone of the hardware, allowing complete isolation for each virtual environment.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Hardware-Supported Virtualisation offers enhanced performance for specific hypervisor types. However, it has limited support and wider adoption compared to other virtualization methods. This trade-off necessitates careful consideration when choosing the right approach for your needs.


### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: "Could building a virtual computer from the ground up actually be faster and more efficient than ever before?"
* **Point of View**: "Imagine being an IT manager tasked with maximizing server utilization for multiple teams in a large company."


### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, then delve into the technical details of simulation. Pause periodically to allow students to absorb the information and ask questions.
* **Analogy**: Compare Hardware-Supported Virtualisation to building a miniature model car with all its parts functioning independently, despite being part of a larger system.

### Interactive Activities for Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
## Debate Topic:

**Is hardware-supported virtualization a viable solution for enhancing performance in specific hypervisor environments despite its limited support and wider adoption challenges?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a scenario where you are tasked with deploying a new virtualization solution for a mission-critical application that requires high performance. Would you prioritize hardware-supported virtualization despite its known limitations, or would you consider alternative approaches? Explain your reasoning and justify your decision based on the strengths and weaknesses of hardware-supported virtualization.**
