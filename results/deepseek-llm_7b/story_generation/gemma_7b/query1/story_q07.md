## Teaching Module: Resource management models
## 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the cloud computing world, resources are like precious jewels. You have servers, storage, and networking capabilities, but they cost money. Inefficient resource management means overspending or underutilizing these assets, leading to performance issues or financial waste.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter resource management models! These models tackle the challenge of efficiently allocating and managing cloud resources. By provisioning only what you need, monitoring usage in real-time, and controlling access, you can optimize performance, reduce costs, and maintain security.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Effective resource management is like playing a balancing act. You need to carefully consider the trade-offs between performance, cost, and security. While efficient resource utilization is a strength, the process can be complex due to the need to balance multiple conflicting factors.


## 2. Storytelling Hooks
