## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
## Storytelling Module: Full Virtualisation

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Data centres were bursting with servers, each running a single application. Managing and provisioning resources was a nightmare.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter the revolutionary concept of **Full Virtualisation**. This technique creates a **virtual machine** that replicates the entire hardware of the underlying server. Now, multiple operating systems can coexist on the same physical hardware, mimicking their dedicated hardware.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Full virtualisation is a game-changer. It dramatically improves resource utilization, enabling efficient deployment of diverse workloads. While offering immense flexibility and compatibility, it also comes with a minor performance hit due to the additional layer of abstraction.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**: Can we make computers smarter by making them less hardware-dependent?

**Point of View**: Let's follow the journey of an engineer tasked with maximizing resource efficiency in a data centre.


### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing**: Introduce the concept slowly, explaining the challenges of traditional server management. Gradually unveil the solution with the 'Aha!' moment. Discuss strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing real-world applications.

**Analogy**: Think of full virtualisation as creating a detailed blueprint of a physical server, allowing you to build a virtual replica with identical specifications.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
## Debate Topic:

**Is full virtualization a viable solution for organizations seeking to maximize resource utilization and workload flexibility while minimizing performance trade-offs?**

## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine you are tasked with designing a mission-critical application that requires high performance and scalability. Would you prioritize full virtualization for its resource utilization benefits, or would you opt for a different approach considering the potential performance limitations? Explain your reasoning and justify your decision based on the strengths and weaknesses of full virtualization.**

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
## 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event):** In the enterprise environment, virtualisation was becoming increasingly popular, but engineers faced compatibility issues with native device drivers and hardware resources when using traditional full-virtualisation. The need for better hardware resource utilisation and native driver compatibility became paramount.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):** Enter para-virtualisation. This innovative method realised that by modifying the guest operating system with hooks, performance and compatibility with physical hardware could be significantly improved. The Type1 Hypervisor facilitated this interaction between the virtual and physical environments.

**The Impact (Meaning):** Para-virtualisation allowed for seamless integration of virtual machines with the underlying hardware, enhancing performance and efficiency in enterprise applications. Its ability to access native drivers and hardware resources without significant overhead made it a valuable tool for cloud computing and virtualisation deployments.


## 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

**Point of View:** Let's explore the journey of a virtual machine from clumsy outsider to capable collaborator, guided by the magic of para-virtualisation.


## 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing:** Introduce the concept of virtualisation and its challenges. Then, present para-virtualisation as the solution, explaining its core features and benefits. Allocate time for questions and discussion about the trade-offs involved.

**Analogy:** Imagine a virtual machine as a student in a new school. Traditional virtualisation is like forcing them to learn everything from scratch. Para-virtualisation is like providing them with a translator, allowing them to understand and interact with the school environment seamlessly.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
## Debate Topic:

**Is para-virtualisation a viable solution for enhancing compatibility when working with native device drivers and hardware resources, despite the need for modifying the guest operating system?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a scenario where you are tasked with deploying an application that requires extensive hardware access on a large scale. Would you prioritize compatibility with native drivers or prioritize seamless virtualisation? Explain your reasoning based on the strengths and weaknesses of para-virtualisation.**

## Teaching Module: Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
## Storytelling Module: Hardware-Supported Virtualisation

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the enterprise world, multiple operating systems often need to coexist on the same physical server. Traditional virtualisation approaches faced limitations in performance and resource management.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Hardware-Supported Virtualisation. This revolutionary technique simulates the behaviour of a specific hypervisor, enabling multiple operating systems to run seamlessly on a single server. The hypervisor is emulated in its entirety, including its features, performance characteristics, and interaction with the underlying hardware.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: This innovative approach offers significant performance advantages for specific hypervisor types. However, Hardware-Supported Virtualisation comes with limitations. Its support is relatively limited, making widespread adoption less common compared to other virtualization methods.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: "Can we create a virtual computer that behaves like the real thing without actually being the real thing?"
* **Point of View**: "Imagine being a system administrator tasked with running different operating systems on a single server. How do you ensure seamless coexistence and optimal performance?"

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, building up to the 'Aha!' moment. Pause for discussion after each segment.
* **Analogy**: Compare Hardware-Supported Virtualisation to creating a virtual toy car that operates like the real thing, but with slightly different rules.

### Interactive Activities for Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
## Debate Topic:

**Is hardware-supported virtualization the future of hypervisor technology, despite its limited support and wider adoption challenges?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a scenario where a new hypervisor type emerges that offers significant performance improvements over existing solutions. Would you prioritize hardware-supported virtualization for this new hypervisor, even if it meant sacrificing wider compatibility? Explain your reasoning based on the strengths and weaknesses of this technology.**
