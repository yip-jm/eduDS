## Teaching Module: Docker
## Storytelling Module: Docker

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Scientists were frustrated with the slow performance of their HPC applications, burdened by the overhead of traditional virtualization. Sharing resources across virtual machines was inefficient, leading to bottlenecks and delays in scientific discoveries.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Docker! Inspired by the need for lightweight and efficient packaging of applications, developers realized that containerization could be the solution. Docker isolates applications with their dependencies, libraries, and configurations, minimizing performance impact on the underlying hardware.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Docker revolutionizes HPC by offering ease of deployment, scalability, and resource isolation. Its lightweight containers share system resources efficiently, eliminating the performance penalties of traditional virtualization. This empowers scientists to focus on their research, knowing their applications will run seamlessly across different environments.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**: Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

**Point of View**: Let's follow the journey of an engineer tasked with building a high-performance computing pipeline.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing**: Introduce Docker with a real-world analogy, such as comparing containers to standardized boxes that can hold different items (applications) without affecting the box itself (hardware). Gradually elaborate on its features and benefits, providing concrete examples of successful HPC deployments.

**Analogy**: Think of Docker as a "zip file" for your entire application. It contains everything needed to run it smoothly, regardless of the underlying system.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
## Debate Topic:

**Is Docker a reliable and secure solution for deploying and managing applications despite its potential security risks?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine you are tasked with developing a mission-critical application that needs to be scaled up quickly and efficiently. How would you leverage Docker's strengths and mitigate its security risks to achieve this goal?**

## Teaching Module: Singularity
## Storytelling Module: Singularity

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Researchers working on complex scientific projects often encounter dependency conflicts when using different computing environments. These conflicts arise from varying libraries, tools, and configurations, leading to inconsistent results and productivity losses.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Singularity! Inspired by Docker's containerization approach, Singularity emerged as a solution for HPC environments. It uses a lightweight runtime environment to package applications along with their dependencies, ensuring consistent execution regardless of the underlying system. This eliminates dependency conflicts and boosts scientific reproducibility.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Singularity empowers researchers to seamlessly move their workloads between different HPC systems without worrying about compatibility issues. Its ability to handle large datasets efficiently makes it ideal for scientific endeavors that require scalable computing power. While its user base is smaller compared to Docker, its portability and dependency management capabilities make it a valuable tool in HPC.


### 2. Storytelling Hooks

- **Dramatic Question**: "Can we build a computer that's so simple, even a toddler can use it, yet still powerful enough to tackle complex scientific challenges?"
- **Point of View**: "Imagine you're a researcher grappling with inconsistent results across different computing environments. Singularity is your guide, ensuring consistent execution and collaborative research."


### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, connecting it to common dependency challenges faced in research projects. Briefly explain Docker as a reference point. Gradually unveil Singularity's features and strengths.
- **Analogy**: Compare Singularity to a "portable library bag" that allows researchers to pack their dependencies and confidently move them between different computers like carrying luggage.

### Interactive Activities for Singularity
## Debate Topic:

**Is the Singularity a more promising solution for addressing computational challenges than Docker, despite its smaller user base?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a future where every individual has access to a pocket-sized computer with unparalleled processing power. How would the strengths and weaknesses of the Singularity influence the way we design and utilize software applications in this setting?**

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
## Storytelling Module: Linux Containers (LXC)

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Imagine building a complex machine with many interconnected parts. Sometimes, parts malfunction or need isolation to avoid affecting the entire machine. This is the dilemma faced by developers working on large-scale systems.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Linux Containers (LXC)! This innovative technology offers a lightweight and efficient way to compartmentalize applications within the operating system. Using namespaces and cgroups, LXC creates isolated environments that share resources while ensuring process isolation.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: This means developers can easily create and manage independent environments for different applications without impacting the entire system. LXC's ease of use and resource efficiency make it ideal for developers familiar with Linux. However, its limitations within the Linux environment necessitate exploring alternative solutions for cross-platform deployments.


### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**: Can we achieve isolation without adding unnecessary weight to the system?

**Point of View**: Let's follow the journey of a system administrator tasked with deploying multiple applications on a Linux server.


### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing**: Introduce the concept with a relatable analogy, such as comparing containers to individual rooms in a shared apartment building. Gradually delve into the technical aspects, highlighting the use of namespaces and cgroups. Allocate time for questions and discussions around the strengths and weaknesses of LXC.

**Analogy**: Think of LXC as providing "containers" within your Linux "apartment building." Each container is a separate space with its own processes and resources, while the entire building (operating system) still shares common infrastructure.

### Interactive Activities for Linux Containers (LXC)
## Debate Topic:

**Is the ease of use and resource efficiency of Linux Containers enough to outweigh their limited portability outside of the Linux environment?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a scenario where a new operating system emerges that offers similar resource efficiency to Linux Containers but boasts seamless cross-platform compatibility. How would this development impact the adoption and implementation of Linux Containers? Explain your reasoning based on the strengths and weaknesses of LXC.**
