## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
### 1. The Story

**The Problem:**  
Before the advent of full virtualization, data centers and server rooms were filled with physical machines dedicated to specific tasks. This approach led to significant underutilization of resources because each server could run only one operating system at a time, regardless of its actual load. **Dramatic Question**: Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

**The 'Aha!' Moment:**  
Imagine an engineer named Alex working at a large tech company, facing the challenge of efficiently managing a growing number of servers. During a brainstorming session, Alex discovers the concept of full virtualization. This method promises to simulate a complete hardware environment for each operating system, allowing multiple OSes to run simultaneously on a single physical server. Alex realizes that by introducing an abstract layer between the hardware and the operating systems, the performance and efficiency of their data centers could be dramatically improved.

**The Impact:**  
Full virtualization is not just a technical workaround; it's a revolution in server management that leads to increased resource utilization, enabling organizations to cut down on hardware costs and energy consumption. By running multiple workloads on a single server, companies can optimize their infrastructure and deploy diverse applications without worrying about compatibility issues. However, Alex also understands the trade-off—additional processing power is required to manage the virtualization layer, which might affect performance in some scenarios. Despite this, the benefits often outweigh the drawbacks, making full virtualization an essential technique in modern data centers and cloud computing.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:**  
"Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?" This intriguing question sparks curiosity and challenges traditional assumptions about computer performance and efficiency.

**Point of View:**  
The story is told from Alex's perspective, providing a relatable journey of discovery and realization as they encounter the concept of full virtualization for the first time.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing:**  
Begin with **The Problem**, creating a sense of urgency or inefficiency to capture students' interest. Then, dive into **The 'Aha!' Moment**, pausing to emphasize Alex's realization and the significance of the discovery. Finally, explore **The Impact**, allowing time for discussion on the benefits and trade-offs to ensure students grasp the complexities and importance of full virtualization.

**Analogy:**  
Explain full virtualization by comparing it to a sophisticated computer game emulator that perfectly mimics the behavior of an old console on a modern PC, allowing you to play games as if you were using the original hardware. This analogy can help students visualize how virtual machines operate within a simulated environment.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
### Debate Topic

**Resolved:** The benefits of full virtualization in terms of resource utilization, flexibility, and workload compatibility outweigh the potential performance trade-offs due to additional layers of abstraction.

### What If Scenario

**Scenario:** Imagine you are a system administrator for a small online bookstore. You have a physical server with adequate hardware capabilities but currently runs a single monolithic application that handles all bookstore operations. Your task is to decide whether to implement full virtualization on this server to host multiple bookstore applications, each running in its own virtual machine. 

**Justification for Choice:** Explain how the strengths of full virtualization justify your decision and why you believe the potential performance trade-offs are either negligible or acceptable for your scenario. Consider factors such as scalability, disaster recovery, and future expansion of the bookstore services. 

By engaging with this scenario, students will need to critically evaluate the trade-offs between increased flexibility and potential performance impacts, applying their understanding of full virtualization's strengths and weaknesses to a real-world context.

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event):** Imagine a world where your computer must run different types of software, each expecting full access to the hardware without interference. This becomes a nightmare when these software programs, or **guest operating systems**, refuse to play nicely with others, demanding all the resources for themselves. *Dramatic Question*: Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):** Enter **para-virtualisation**—the ingenious solution born from the challenges of virtualization. It involves a bit of a magic trick: modifying the guest operating systems so they can work with a set of special instructions, or **hooks**, provided by the host system, known as a Type 1 hypervisor. This allows for improved simulation of machine execution, turning virtual machines into well-behaved digital citizens that can share resources effectively.

**The Impact (Meaning):** *Why it matters*: By using para-virtualisation, we gain better compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources, which is crucial in an enterprise environment where consistency and reliability are paramount. However, this comes at a cost: the guest operating systems need to be modified, which might not always be practical or desirable, especially for systems that are already fully functional.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

**Point of View:** Narrate the story from the perspective of an engineer tasked with optimizing the performance of a virtualized environment for a large corporation. This POV allows students to empathize with the challenges faced by professionals.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing:** Start by painting the picture of the problem—describe the chaos of incompatible software demanding full hardware access. Then, after setting up the **Dramatic Question**, unveil para-virtualisation as the "aha" solution, slowly explaining how it works through the **'Aha!' Moment** section. Finally, delve into the **Impact** to solidify understanding and conclude with a discussion on the trade-offs.

**Analogy:** Explain para-virtualisation by comparing it to a bouncer at a club. The bouncer (Type 1 hypervisor) knows everyone (guest OSes) who comes in and out, and gives special instructions (hooks) to some guests (modified OSes) to ensure smooth entry and exit, thus managing the crowd better than if everyone was just pushing through without order. This analogy helps students visualize how the modified guest OSes are given special treatment to work more efficiently within a virtualized environment.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
### Debate Topic:
"Should the benefits of para-virtualization's better compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources outweigh its requirement for modifying the guest operating system?"

### What If Scenario Question:
"What if you are tasked with setting up a new virtual environment for a software development project? Considering para-virtualization's strengths (better compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources) and weaknesses (requires modification of the guest operating system), which approach would you choose, and why? Justify your decision based on the trade-offs involved."

## Teaching Module: Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

**The Problem:** Imagine you're an engineer managing a bustling tech company. Your servers are like the engines of your company's cars, and each car needs its own engine to run. However, you have a fleet with many different types of cars, and not all engines are compatible with every car. This leads to inefficiency and waste because each car has its specific type of engine.

**The 'Aha!' Moment:** One day, you stumble upon the concept of *hardware-supported virtualisation*. It's like discovering a magical engine that can perfectly mimic any car engine you need. *Fully simulates* means it perfectly replicates the performance and behavior of the exact type of engine your cars need. *Enables multiple operating systems to run on one physical server* is like having one engine that can switch between different types seamlessly.

**The Impact:** This discovery is *huge* because it allows you to consolidate your servers, saving space and reducing costs. However, you realize there's a *catch*. While this method might offer *better performance characteristics* for specific types of engines (hypervisors), it's *not widely adopted* due to limited support across all server types. This means not all cars can benefit from this magic engine—only the ones with the right type.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** "Could making a computer dumber by emulating its behavior actually make it more powerful?"

**Point of View:** Narrate from the perspective of an engineer who is constantly on the lookout for ways to optimize server resources without compromising performance.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing:** Pause after explaining the problem to let students think about the inefficiency. Then, dramatically reveal the "magical" solution with a dramatic pause before diving into how it works.

**Analogy:** Compare hardware-supported virtualisation to having a single gaming console that can emulate any video game console you own—perfectly mimicking the controls, graphics, and gameplay of each console, but only if that console's games are supported by the emulator. Discuss the pros (efficiency, space-saving) and cons (limited support, investment in specific types of "game consoles").

### Interactive Activities for Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
### Debate Topic:
"Despite potentially offering better performance characteristics for specific hypervisor types, the limited support and adoption of hardware-supported virtualisation make it a less viable option compared to software-based solutions for most educational institutions."

### What If Scenario Question:
Imagine your school decides to implement virtual machines to enhance learning experiences. Given the strengths and weaknesses of hardware-supported virtualisation, what approach would you recommend the school take? Justify your choice considering the trade-offs between better performance for certain hypervisors and the broader adoption and support of software-based virtualisation solutions in educational settings.
