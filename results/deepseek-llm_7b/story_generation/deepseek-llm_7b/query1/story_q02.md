## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

--

The Problem (Event): In a world of limited resources and diverse workloads, data centers were facing a challenge in effectively managing their hardware assets. Each server was dedicated to a single operating system or application, making efficient use of the underlying device difficult. This resulted in wasted resources as servers remained idle while waiting for other applications that required them.

--

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Enter full virtualization - an innovative technology that revolutionizes how we think about and utilize our hardware assets. It provides a virtual machine, fully simulating all the physical characteristics of underlying devices. This means multiple operating systems can now run on one single server!

--

The Impact (Meaning): Full Virtualization is a game-changer in modern data centers and cloud computing. Its significance goes beyond just resource utilization - it enables flexibility by allowing diverse workloads to coexist on a single physical server, thus increasing efficiency. However, it's important to note that there are trade-offs; performance may be slightly affected due to the additional layers of abstraction.

2. Storytelling Hooks

--

Dramatic Question: "Could making our computer 'dumb' actually make it smarter?"
Point of View: "From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge, full virtualization seems like the ultimate solution for managing diverse workloads and wasted resources."

3. Classroom Delivery Tips

Pacing: Pause after explaining key points to allow students to process the information before moving on.
Analogy: A simple analogy could be "imagine if you had different types of cake recipes, each with unique ingredients and baking requirements - full virtualization would enable you to bake all these cakes in one single oven." This helps illustrate how diverse workloads can coexist efficiently on a single server.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Full Virtualisation Increases Resource Utilization - Is it Worth Sacrificing Performance?"
Strengths: Full virtualisation allows for increased resource utilisation by allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical server, leading to better workload compatibility and more flexibility in terms of application deployment. This can result in cost savings as fewer servers are needed.
Weaknesses: While the concept increases resource utilisation, it may also lead to performance trade-offs due to additional layers of abstraction required for running multiple operating systems on a single physical server. It could potentially slow down system response times and introduce bottlenecks.
2. What If Scenario Question: "Your school is planning to upgrade its computer lab with full virtualisation technology. The administration believes it will be more cost-effective, but some teachers argue that the performance trade-offs may negatively impact student learning. If you were in charge of implementing this change, would you choose full virtualisation or stick with traditional server hardware?"

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem – Solution – Impact)

Once upon a time in the world of computing, there existed an issue with virtualisation. Virtual machines were unable to fully simulate machine execution, leaving room for errors and performance issues. This was particularly frustrating when it came to native device drivers and hardware resources that needed compatibility from the guest operating system. 

One day, someone had a brilliant idea: let's modify the guest operating system to use hooks! By doing so, we could improve machine execution simulation without affecting the other virtual machines on our platform. And thus, Para-virtualisation was born.

The Impact of this discovery is huge - not only did it solve the compatibility issue for native device drivers and hardware resources but also improved overall performance in enterprise environments. 

2. Storytelling Hooks

"Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter? Introducing Para-virtualisation, a method that transforms how we use virtual machines."

3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* To emphasize the concept's significance, start by asking students what they know about virtualization and mention this issue of compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources. 
* Use an analogy for understanding - imagine your computer as a puppet master controlling many different characters (virtual machines). The modifications in the guest operating system would be like giving them new sets of tools to perform better actions!

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Should Para-Virtualisation be prioritised for better compatibility or avoided due to system modifications?"
   - Strengths: Better hardware resources usage, reduced driver conflicts, improved performance of native applications.
   - Weaknesses: Requires modifying the guest operating system, potential security risks, increased complexity in managing virtual machines.

2. 'What If' Scenario Question: "If a school district needs to run various educational software on an outdated device that has limited hardware resources. Should they choose para-virtualisation for better performance or opt for a light-weight hypervisor to save system modifications?"

## Teaching Module: Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
#### The Story (Problem – Solution – Impact)

In the early days of computer hardware, companies would build and design specialized servers for each operating system they wanted to run on their network. This resulted in high costs and limited resources for these enterprises due to the need for multiple physical servers to accommodate various OS needs. Imagine if we could use a single server and simultaneously run different operating systems without compromising performance?

Enter hardware-supported virtualization, the 'Aha!' moment! It enables each of those specialized servers to be simulated within one powerful machine by fully emulating its specific hypervisor's behavior and performance characteristics. This allows multiple operating systems to share resources efficiently on a single physical server, reducing costs while increasing productivity. 

This breakthrough concept has significant implications for enterprise environments. The ability to run various OSes simultaneously in an optimized manner drastically improves efficiency. However, hardware-supported virtualization is limited by its support and adoption compared to other types of virtualization. It may offer better performance characteristics for specific hypervisor types but could have a more restricted scope than others due to the less widespread acceptance.

#### Storytelling Hooks

"Imagine if we had a way to make our computer hardware smarter, using one server as multiple specialized servers without compromising performance or resources? That's what hardware-supported virtualization does for enterprise environments." 

#### Classroom Delivery Tips

* Pacing: Start by explaining the challenge faced by enterprises with separate physical servers. Then dive into the concept and its benefits (simultaneous running of different OSes). Finally, discuss the trade-offs in terms of support and adoption.
* Analogy: Imagine a car having multiple drivers using it for their preferred speed, comfort levels, or destinations while maintaining smooth and efficient operations - that's what hardware-supported virtualization does for computing systems!

### Interactive Activities for Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Should Hardware-Supported Virtualisation be Widely Adopted Despite Its Limited Support?"
The question statement would look like this: Imagine you are an IT expert working for a large corporation that has recently adopted hardware-supported virtualisation technology, but the vendor offering support and maintenance is going out of business. Should the company invest in additional training to learn how to manage the system independently or should they consider switching to a different hypervisor type due to limited support? Discuss the pros and cons of adopting this particular type of virtualisation technology despite its weaknesses.
2. 'What If' Scenario Question: "If you were managing a high-performance data centre, would you choose hardware-supported virtualization over a cloud-based solution?"
The question statement would look like this: Imagine that your organization has been tasked with setting up and maintaining an efficient, cost-effective data center for the next five years. You have the choice between deploying a hardware-supported virtualisation system or opting for a cloud-based solution. Both options offer distinct performance characteristics but come with different levels of vendor support. Discuss the pros and cons of each option and justify your decision based on the trade-offs in this hypothetical scenario.
