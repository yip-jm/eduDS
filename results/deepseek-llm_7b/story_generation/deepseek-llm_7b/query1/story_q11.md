## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

The Problem (Event): Imagine you're working with your team on building an application that requires secure storage and processing of sensitive customer data. You have different responsibilities as an individual within this project, but how much should you worry about the security infrastructure?

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): The Shared Responsibility Model was a revelation for us. This concept divides the responsibility between cloud users (customers) and cloud service providers for ensuring secure operations on the cloud. According to the model, customers are responsible for securing their data, applications, and infrastructure, while cloud service providers manage the underlying cloud infrastructure such as servers, storage, networking etc.

The Impact (Meaning): Understanding this concept is crucial because it ensures that both parties understand what they should focus on when operating in a shared environment. The trade-off is that customers must put effort into securing their applications and data, while service providers can concentrate on maintaining the overall cloud infrastructure security. 

2. Storytelling Hooks:

---

Dramatic Question: Can you confidently entrust your sensitive data to someone else without worrying about how secure it truly is?
Point of View: From the perspective of a security engineer, this concept ensures that we know exactly what our responsibility entails and allows us to focus on protecting specific applications or data within the cloud.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

---

Pacing: When discussing this model in class, take your time explaining each aspect of shared responsibilities between customers and service providers. Ask questions like "How do you think having a clear understanding of responsibility can impact secure operations?"

Analogy: Imagine the cloud provider as the landlord of an apartment building, while the customer is the tenant who focuses on securing their own living space (applications) but also shares in ensuring that the common spaces are safe and secure for everyone.

## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management
-----
1. The Story (Problem – Solution – Impact)

The Problem (Event): Imagine you are an IT manager of a company with multiple departments operating in different cloud environments. You have noticed that some employees can access sensitive data without permission while others cannot access crucial resources they need to perform their jobs effectively. Your concern is about maintaining security and ensuring only authorized users can access the data they require.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Identity & Access Management, or IAM for short, addresses this challenge by controlling user access to resources within a cloud environment. It involves managing identities and permissions to ensure that only authorized users can access the data they need. When implemented correctly, it provides an essential layer of security in any cloud-based application.

The Impact (Meaning): Identity & Access Management is vital for securing your cloud environments because unauthorized access to sensitive information could lead to severe consequences such as financial losses or breaches of privacy. On the other hand, IAM may impose a certain level of complexity and additional costs on organizations due to its need for careful management. However, in today's world where data security is paramount, it becomes an essential practice to protect your organization from malicious actors.
