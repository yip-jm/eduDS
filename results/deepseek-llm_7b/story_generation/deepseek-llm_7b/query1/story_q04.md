## Teaching Module: Docker
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

---

The Problem (Event): Imagine you're working on a project that requires multiple applications running simultaneously. You find it tedious and time-consuming to set up each application with its specific dependencies, libraries, system tools, and configuration files every time you need them. It takes hours of manual work just for the setup alone!

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Enter Docker - a containerization platform that automates software packaging, deployment, and scaling. With Docker, you can package your application with its dependencies into lightweight containers, which are isolated from each other and run on their own namespaces. Containers share system resources with the host, allowing them to avoid penalties incurred on hardware.

The Impact (Meaning): This breakthrough concept has revolutionized how we deploy applications in a consistent environment across different computing environments. Docker enables us to create highly portable containers that can be used for application deployment and scaling tasks effortlessly. We no longer have to waste time configuring dependencies, libraries, system tools, or configuration files every time we need them.

2. Storytelling Hooks

---

Dramatic Question: Can making a computer dumber actually make it smarter? (By "dumb," I mean focusing on one task at a time; and by "smart" referring to the ability of containers to optimize resource allocation.)

Point of View: From the perspective of an engineer facing complex dependencies in application deployment.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips

---

Pacing: Discuss Docker's benefits while deploying applications, such as faster setup times, consistent environments, and easy scaling. Then discuss how it optimizes resource utilization using hypervisor-based virtualization dependency reduction, just-in-time compilation for performance optimization, and shared resources between the host machine and containers.

Analogy: Imagine you have a toolbox with various tools that each perform specific tasks. With Docker, we can create separate toolboxes (containers) to contain different application dependencies instead of having all tools mixed in one big toolbox. This way, when needed, we can grab only the appropriate toolbox (container), and our workspace remains tidy without clutter!

### Interactive Activities for Docker
1. Debate Topic: "Is Docker's ease of application deployment and scalability worth potential security risks?"

Statement: "Using Docker for application deployment provides developers with an efficient way to deploy applications, but at the cost of increased susceptibility to security vulnerabilities." 

2. 'What If' Scenario Question: "If you are a project manager overseeing a web development team that is considering using Docker for their projects, would you choose to use it or recommend against it? Please justify your decision based on its trade-offs with regard to application deployment and scalability versus security risks."

## Teaching Module: Singularity
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

The Problem (Event): Researchers and scientists around the world faced a major challenge when it came to running complex simulations and applications on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems. Each new system had its own unique software requirements, making it difficult for researchers to transfer their work from one environment to another. This dependency confusion led to wasted time and resources, hindering scientific progress.

The 'Aha! Moment (Experience): Enter Singularity - a revolutionary containerization platform developed by the Open Science Grid specifically designed for HPC environments. It uses a lightweight runtime called Singularity that provides consistent execution no matter what operating system or hardware configuration is in use. 

The Impact (Meaning): The introduction of Singularity revolutionized the way researchers operate on HPC systems, enabling them to easily transfer their applications and workflows across diverse computing environments without any dependency conflicts. This had a significant impact by saving countless hours that would have otherwise been spent on software installation and configuration issues. Furthermore, it allowed scientists to focus more on their research instead of spending time dealing with technical challenges.

2. Storytelling Hooks:

- Dramatic Question: Can a simple containerization solution transform the way we work in HPC environments? 
- Point of View: From the perspective of a researcher juggling different computing systems, Singularity provides a powerful tool to streamline their workflow and accelerate scientific progress.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

* Pacing: When explaining how Singularity works, start by discussing its lightweight runtime and dependency management features before diving into its application in HPC environments. 
* Analogy: Imagine that each computing system is a unique kitchen with specific ingredients (software packages). Singularity takes these diverse ingredients and packages them together into neat little containers (containers), ensuring consistency across different kitchens (computing systems) while avoiding any ingredient conflicts (dependency issues).

### Interactive Activities for Singularity
1. Debate Topic: "Is Singularity more valuable due to its efficient handling of large data sets or its portability across diverse computing environments?"
2. What If Scenario Question: Imagine you're part of a team developing an advanced artificial intelligence system that requires processing and analyzing vast amounts of data from various sources. Would you choose the Singularity platform for its ability to handle big data more effectively, even if it has a smaller user base compared to Docker? Or would you opt for Docker despite having a larger community with stronger support, but potentially facing performance issues when handling large datasets?

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
1. The Story (Problem  ->  Solution  ->  Impact)

The Problem (Event): A Linux distribution company was facing performance issues with their Docker containers on shared hosts. Each container required significant resources leading to overloading of host systems and reduced performance.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): One day, a system administrator stumbled upon LXC while searching for ways to optimize resource usage within the existing Linux environment. LXC provided an easy way to create lightweight containers without relying on Docker or other containerization solutions. This newfound solution allowed each container to share resources with the host while maintaining process isolation through namespaces and cgroups.

The Impact (Meaning): The discovery of LXC had a significant impact on their shared hosting infrastructure. By using LXC, they were able to create multiple lightweight containers that ran smoothly without overloading the host systems. This allowed them to allocate more resources for other tasks while maintaining performance levels. Additionally, since LXC was built into the Linux operating system, it provided an easy solution with no additional software or configuration needed.

2. Storytelling Hooks:
- Dramatic Question: Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?
- Point of View: From the perspective of a developer seeking efficient resource management solutions.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:
- Pacing: When discussing LXC, pause after explaining the problem and before diving into the solution to allow students to connect the dots themselves.
- Analogy: Imagine each container as a separate room in your home; with LXC, you can share resources between rooms while still maintaining privacy for each space (i.e., process isolation).

### Interactive Activities for Linux Containers (LXC)
1. Debate Topic: "Should Linux Containers (LXC) be used as an alternative to traditional virtualization for system administration tasks?"
Proponents argue:
Strengths: LXC is more efficient in terms of resource usage, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments where performance and efficiency are crucial factors. Additionally, existing Linux users may find it easier to manage and implement since they already have a solid understanding of the platform.
2. What If Scenario Question: "Suppose you need to deploy an application that requires high levels of security on different operating systems. Which would be the better choice for this scenario - traditional virtualization or LXC?"
Answer justification: Students should consider the trade-offs between resource efficiency and portability when making their decision. Traditional virtualization might require more resources, but it offers greater flexibility in terms of supporting multiple platforms. On the other hand, LXC is a lightweight solution that can be implemented easily on Linux systems, but lacks support for different operating systems.
