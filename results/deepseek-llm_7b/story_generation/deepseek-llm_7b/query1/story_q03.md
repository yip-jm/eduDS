## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem  ->   'Aha!' Moment  ->   Impact)

---

Once upon a time, in a large corporate data center, IT administrators were tasked with managing an ever-growing number of servers and applications. Each server was dedicated to running one specific operating system, which meant that each physical machine could only support a single workload. This led to wasted resources as entire machines would sit idle when not needed by their primary application.

One day, a brilliant IT engineer stumbled upon the concept of full virtualization. It allowed him to fully simulate all the hardware of a device and create a virtual machine, enabling multiple operating systems to run on one physical server. This meant that instead of having separate servers for each workload, they could share resources efficiently while still isolating their respective environments.

With this newfound knowledge, the engineer was able to drastically reduce the number of physical machines needed in the data center, saving both time and money during deployment and maintenance. The virtualization not only increased resource utilization but also enabled a more flexible environment where diverse workloads could coexist on one server. This allowed for easier scaling up or down as needed without worrying about compatibility issues between different applications.

2. Storytelling Hooks
- "In today's data centers, maximizing efficiency is key. What if there was a way to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine? Let us explore the world of full virtualization and see how it can revolutionize the way we manage our digital infrastructure."

a) Pacing: "Imagine you're an engineer trying to manage a growing number of servers efficiently. Introduce the concept of full virtualization, its benefits in resource utilization and flexibility, while also touching upon potential trade-offs such as performance impacts. Allow time for students to grasp this new idea before moving on."

b) Analogy: "Think of each physical server as an isolated island - only one operating system can thrive there at a time. Full virtualization is like creating bridges between these islands, allowing them to coexist and share resources more efficiently while maintaining their individual environments."

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Is full virtualization worth performance trade-offs in favor of increased resource utilization, flexibility, and workload compatibility?"

Step 1: Identify key strengths and weaknesses
    - Strengths: Increases resource utilization, flexibility, and workload compatibility
    - Weaknesses: May have performance trade-offs due to additional layers of abstraction

Step 2: Create a clear, debatable statement that pits the strengths against the weaknesses.
    Debate Topic Statement: "While full virtualization offers increased efficiency in terms of resources, workloads, and flexibility, it may negatively impact system performance due to added levels of abstraction."

1. What If Scenario Question:

Step 1: Create a hypothetical scenario involving a company that is considering the use of full virtualization for its operations.
    Company A is looking into implementing a full virtualization solution in order to improve resource utilization and workload compatibility, while minimizing hardware costs.

Step 2: Force students to apply the concept by asking them to justify their choice based on trade-offs.
What If Question: "If Company A chooses to implement full virtualization for improved resource allocation, what potential performance issues could arise from these additional layers of abstraction, and how might they impact the company's operations?"

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem → Solution → Impact)

Once upon a time in the world of computing, there was an enterprise environment that required multiple operating systems on one physical machine to run smoothly together. However, this posed a problem as each operating system needed its own dedicated hardware resources for optimal performance. This led to conflicts and inefficiencies within the machines, causing frustration among engineers trying to maintain them.

In response to this challenge, an innovative concept was introduced: para-virtualisation. Imagine if we could create a layer between these different operating systems that allowed them to share hardware resources without interfering with each other's operations. This would allow for better compatibility and efficiency in the enterprise environment. 

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)

Engineers experimented with modifying one of the guest operating systems to use hooks, which are essentially pieces of code embedded within the OS that can be accessed by a hypervisor - or more specifically, Type1 Hypervisors. By doing this, they were able to create a layer between the different operating systems on the machine, allowing them to share hardware resources without interfering with each other's operations.

The Impact (Meaning)

Para-virtualisation became an essential tool in enterprise environments due to its ability to provide better compatibility and efficiency within multi-OS machines. It enabled engineers to allocate hardware resources optimally for all operating systems on the machine, reducing conflicts and increasing overall performance. However, it did come with a trade-off: para-virtualisation required modification of the guest operating system, which could be seen as an inconvenience by some users. Despite this challenge, para-virtualisation remains a valuable tool in enterprise computing due to its ability to enhance efficiency and resource sharing among different operating systems on one machine.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Should para-virtualization be preferred over paravirtualization for cloud computing?"
The debate topic pits the strengths of better compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources against the weaknesses of requiring modification of the guest operating system. Students can argue in favor or against using para-virtualization for cloud computing, based on its trade-offs in terms of efficiency, ease of implementation, and flexibility.

2. What If Scenario Question: "A company is considering using a cloud service provider that uses para-virtualized environments to support their remote employees' workstations. If the company decides to use this technology for their needs, what potential benefits or drawbacks could they experience in terms of performance, cost, and security?" 
This scenario question encourages students to think critically about the trade-offs between using para-virtualization versus other cloud computing solutions by analyzing its potential impact on performance (hardware resources), costs associated with modification of guest operating systems, and overall security implications.

In an enterprise environment, companies often have multiple applications running on various servers. Managing these resources can be time-consuming and costly due to hardware limitations, lack of server capacity, or compatibility issues with different operating systems.

Enter the innovative concept of Hardware-Supported Virtualisation! This exciting discovery allows enterprises to fully simulate a specific type of hypervisor while enabling multiple operating systems to run on one physical server. The impact is significant: companies can save costs by consolidating their servers and optimize hardware usage, ultimately reducing energy consumption as well.

As you introduce this concept to your students, emphasize that virtualization is not just about creating multiple virtual machines on one physical server but also involves fully simulating the behavior and performance characteristics of a hypervisor type.

To make it relatable for younger learners, compare hardware-supported virtualisation with playing with building blocks: Imagine trying to build different structures (applications) using various types of bricks (servers). With traditional methods, you would need separate sets of identical bricks for each structure, wasting resources and limiting creativity. But by utilizing Hardware-Supported Virtualization, students can use a limited set of diverse "bricks" (physical servers), creating endless combinations of applications without sacrificing performance or efficiency!

### Interactive Activities for Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Hardware-Supported Virtualization is Superior for Performance but Lacks Widespread Adoption"

Statement: Hardware-supported virtualization offers better performance characteristics for specific hypervisor types, while lacking widespread support and adoption. 

Syllabus Outline: 
I. Introduction to hardware-supported virtualization (HSV) - its definition, benefits, and drawbacks
II. Comparing HSV with other virtualization methods like software-based virtualization and cloud computing
III. Explanation of the potential performance advantages provided by specific hypervisor types in an HSV environment
IV. Discussing why widespread adoption is limited for hardware-supported virtualization compared to its competitors
V. Debating whether the trade-offs between better performance characteristics, support and adoption are worth considering hardware-supported virtualization over other methods
VI. Conclusion - summarizing the debate and presenting a conclusion on whether HSV should be prioritized or not in specific applications based on available resources. 

2. What If Scenario: "What if your school was to implement an HSV server for computational heavy tasks?"

Scenario: Your school has been using one of its computer labs for multiple years, and the machines are becoming increasingly slow due to high processing demands from students working on large research projects or running computationally intensive simulations. The IT department is considering implementing a hardware-supported virtualization solution for better performance in this lab. Students must justify their choice by weighing the pros and cons of HSV as compared to other options (software-based virtualization, cloud computing). They need to analyze how HSV could potentially increase computational speeds on these heavy tasks, while also acknowledging potential drawbacks such as limited support and adoption, and compare it with alternative solutions. Finally, they must justify their recommendation by considering the available budget, maintenance costs, security implications, and user experience for both students and teachers in this scenario.
