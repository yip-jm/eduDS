## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem → Solution → Impact)

---

The Problem (Event): Imagine you have a powerful computer that's capable of running multiple high-performance applications simultaneously. However, each application requires its own specific hardware setup to run efficiently, such as different processors or operating systems. This means that your powerful machine is often underutilized and unable to handle the full potential of its capabilities due to the limitations imposed by these individual requirements.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Full Virtualization allows you to create virtual machines on a single physical machine, each with its own software setup, much like running multiple operating systems or applications simultaneously but without needing dedicated hardware for each one. This means that the powerful computer can run more efficiently and be utilized at its full potential by providing isolation between these virtual machines.

The Impact (Meaning): Full Virtualization is a powerful technique that enables efficient utilization of your computer's resources, allowing you to optimize performance while running multiple operating systems or applications simultaneously on a single machine. It also allows for resource pooling, where one physical machine can support numerous different environments without the need for dedicated hardware setups for each environment. However, it's important to note that performance may be affected by the complexity of the virtualization layer, which is a trade-off for increased efficiency and utilization.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

*Pacing*: When explaining this concept, take your time to ensure that students understand the different layers of virtualization, including how it works, its advantages, and potential drawbacks. Pause periodically to allow questions or comments from the class before continuing.

*Analogies*: Imagine full virtualization as a way to run multiple programs on one computer without each program interfering with others. This can be compared to using a single computer for running multiple operating systems simultaneously.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Should Full Virtualization be prioritized for resource efficiency over potential performance impacts?"
Statement: "Full virtualization is an effective way of managing hardware resources in organizations; however, it may lead to slower system response times due to the added complexity of the virtualization layer."
2. What If Scenario Question: Imagine your school has just invested in a new high-performance server for its computer lab. The IT department wants you and your classmates to help decide how this resource should be best utilized. One option is running multiple operating systems simultaneously, while another option involves using the powerful hardware solely for one primary application. Based on the concept of full virtualization discussed above, would you prioritize efficiency over potential performance impacts by dedicating resources to multiple operating systems, or invest in a single, heavy-duty program that could potentially utilize all available processing power?

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

The Problem (Event): Imagine you are an IT administrator managing several virtual machines in your data center. You've noticed that some of these VMs run slowly and consume more power than necessary. You want to find a way to make them more efficient without having to replace the hardware.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Enter para-virtualization, which is enabled by Type 1 hypervisors like VMware ESXi. Para-virtualization involves modifying the guest operating system's code and kernel so that it runs directly on top of the hypervisor. This means guests do not need to emulate hardware components, leading to better performance and efficiency.

The Impact (Meaning): The significance of para-virtualization is immense. It allows for more efficient use of resources in enterprise environments where multiple VMs are running simultaneously. By eliminating the need for hardware emulation, guest operating systems can run faster and consume less power. However, there are also some trade-offs to consider: modifying guest OS code may lead to compatibility issues.

Pacing: Start by introducing the problem of slow and power-hungry VMs, then proceed to explain how para-virtualization can help solve it. Finally, discuss its trade-offs to help students understand why this concept matters in real-world scenarios.

Analogy: Imagine you're using a smartphone with multiple apps running simultaneously - closing unused apps will free up memory and make the phone run smoother. Para-virtualization is like 'closing' virtualized applications on your hypervisor, making them more efficient without needing to replace hardware or emulating components.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Should Para-Virtualisation be prioritised for performance over compatibility?"
Strengths - Better performance and efficiency compared to full virtualization
Weaknesses - Guest operating systems need to be modified which can lead to compatibility issues. 

2. What If Scenario Question: Imagine a company that uses multiple virtual machines, each running different business applications. They decide to adopt para-virtualisation for better performance but end up facing significant compatibility problems with some of their guest operating systems. In this scenario, students will have to evaluate whether the trade-offs between improved performance and reduced compatibility are worth it in this situation.

## Teaching Module: Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem → Solution → Impact)

--

In an enterprise environment, there was a pressing challenge that IT administrators and engineers faced daily - managing multiple virtual machines on a single physical server. Each machine required resources such as CPU, memory, and storage space to function efficiently. With so many VMs running simultaneously, it became increasingly difficult for each one to get the necessary hardware support they needed to run optimally.

One day, an IT engineer stumbled upon a breakthrough solution - Hardware-Supported Virtualization. This innovative approach allowed virtual machines to be more efficient than software-based solutions by directly leveraging the power of the underlying hardware. Intel VT-d (Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O) and AMD-V (AMD Virtualization), two powerful hardware technologies, provided this support.

The Impact was significant: with Hardware-Supported Virtualization, IT administrators could run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single physical server, improving resource utilization and performance in the process. Furthermore, it allowed for better isolation between VMs, ensuring data privacy and security within each machine.

### Interactive Activities for Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Hardware-supported virtualisation results in better performance than software-based solutions"
In recent years, there has been an ongoing debate between hardware-supported virtualization and software-based solutions for server virtualization. While some argue that hardware-supported virtualization offers superior performance compared to its software counterparts, others contend that the performance of both options is largely dependent on a specific hardware configuration. Arguing in favor of hardware-supported virtualisation:
a) Better Performance - Hardware-supported virtualization allows for better application performance by allowing direct access to resources and hardware components within the host system. In contrast, software-based solutions often rely on complex resource management algorithms that can introduce overheads and inefficiencies which affect overall performance.
b) Increased Efficiency - The use of specialised hardware accelerators in hardware-supported virtualisation enables faster data processing and networking speeds compared to traditional software methods. Additionally, hardware virtualization provides the capability for more efficient load balancing as resources are shared between different virtual machines (VM).
c) Better Resource Utilisation - Hardware-supported virtualization allows better resource utilisation by offering higher scalability and capacity to support multiple VMs on a single host machine. This is particularly beneficial in environments where server consolidation is required, such as data centres or cloud computing services.
2. What If Scenario Question: Consider the following scenario for your students to analyse hardware-supported virtualisation's strengths and weaknesses:
"A business needs to set up two new servers; one will handle email processing tasks while the other manages customer orders. With a tight budget, they have the option of purchasing either a high-performance server or using software-based virtualization. What should their decision be based on the trade-offs between hardware-supported virtualisation and software-based solutions?"
To answer this question, students need to consider various factors such as performance requirements for each task, cost limitations, scalability needs, resource utilisation possibilities, and potential future expansion of workloads. They will then weigh these considerations against one another in order to determine whether investing in a high-performance server or opting for software-based virtualization is the better choice based on their specific needs.
