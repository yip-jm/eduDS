## Teaching Module: Docker
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event):
In a bustling city, there was a busy harbor where ships would come and go, carrying all sorts of cargo. But the docks were getting crowded, and it was becoming harder for the shipbuilders to keep track of everything. They needed a better way to organize and transport their goods.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):
One day, a brilliant idea struck the harbor master. Instead of trying to fit all the cargo into one giant ship, he would divide it into smaller containers that could be easily stacked and moved around. Each container held only one type of cargo, making it easier to find what they needed when it was time to unload. This new method quickly caught on, and soon everyone in the harbor was using these clever containers.

#### The Impact (Meaning):
These containers not only made things easier for the shipbuilders but also saved them time and money. They could now move more goods with fewer ships, which meant less wear and tear on their vehicles and a reduction in fuel costs. But there was a catch: these containers were lightweight, which meant they needed to be handled carefully to avoid damage.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question**: What if we could create a system that would package applications with all their necessary components and run them consistently across different environments?
- **Point of View**: Imagine you're an IT manager struggling to deploy software across multiple platforms and maintain consistency among teams.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Start by introducing the concept of Docker and its definition, then move on to the key points. Pause after each point to allow students to ask questions or make comments.
- **Analogy**: Think of Docker as a toolkit that allows you to build a Lego house with all the same pieces, no matter where in the world you are. It ensures consistency and makes it easy to move your Lego house from one place to another without any damage.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
 1. **Debate Topic**: "While Docker provides significant advantages in terms of ease of application deployment, scalability, and resource isolation, these benefits may be overshadowed by potential security risks if not properly managed. Should companies prioritize the adoption of Docker technology, knowing that it might pose certain security threats?"

2. **What If Scenario Question**: "Suppose a small startup is choosing between using Docker for their application deployment and management or opting for a more traditional method. Considering the strengths (ease of application deployment, scalability, and resource isolation) and weaknesses (potential security risks if not properly managed), which approach would you recommend and why?"

## Teaching Module: Singularity
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event): High Stakes Competition
In the world of high-performance computing, researchers and scientists were in a constant race to solve complex problems as quickly as possible. They needed a way to run their applications across diverse systems without worrying about dependency conflicts or compatibility issues. This often led to inconsistent results, and many hours were spent troubleshooting these issues.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Discovering Singularity
One day, a team of experts came up with a solution called "Singularity." It was a containerization platform that focused on portability across high-performance computing environments. Singularity used a special runtime to create isolated containers for running applications, ensuring consistent execution and avoiding dependency conflicts. This meant that researchers could run their applications across different systems without any hiccups.

#### The Impact (Meaning): A Game Changer in the HPC World
Singularity was a game changer in the high-performance computing world. Its portability allowed it to work seamlessly across diverse environments, and its efficient handling of large data sets made it an ideal choice for researchers dealing with massive datasets. However, despite these strengths, Singularity had a smaller user base compared to Docker, a more widely known platform.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question: Can we solve the problem without losing portability?
#### Point of View: From the perspective of a scientist struggling with dependency conflicts while running their experiments.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
#### Pacing:
- Introduce the concept of Singularity and its importance in high-performance computing.
- Pause for a moment to let the students absorb the information and then continue with the story.

#### Analogy:
Think of Singularity as a universal toolbox that allows scientists and researchers to carry out their experiments in different workshops without worrying about the differences between them. Just like how having one toolbox can help you work on various projects, Singularity enables consistent execution across diverse computing environments.

### Interactive Activities for Singularity
 1. Debate Topic: "Should Singularity be preferred over Docker for managing applications in diverse computing environments?"
2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a scenario where a company needs to deploy large data processing tasks across multiple platforms with varying computational capabilities. Would you choose Singularity or Docker as the primary containerization solution, and why?"

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
 ## The Story

Once upon a time in a land filled with computers, there were many developers and administrators who needed to run multiple applications on a single system without them interfering with each other. However, each application needed its own space, its own set of resources, and isolation from the rest. This was a problem because it required more resources than available and created a complex environment for managing those resources.

One day, an ingenious developer stumbled upon the concept of Linux Containers (LXC). LXC is a built-in solution in the Linux operating system, providing an easy way to create lightweight containers. It shares resources with the host while maintaining process isolation through namespaces and cgroups. This 'Aha!' moment transformed how applications were managed on a single system.

The significance of LXC lies in its ability to offer a balance between resource efficiency and isolation. For existing Linux users, this solution is easy to use and doesn't require additional resources or tools. However, one limitation is that it is not easily portable outside of the Linux environment. Nevertheless, its importance lies in its ability to create isolated environments for running applications while maintaining resource efficiency.

## Storytelling Hooks
- Dramatic Question: Can a single system host multiple applications without compromising performance or security?
- Point of View: From the perspective of an administrator responsible for managing multiple applications on a shared system.

## Classroom Delivery Tips
- Pacing: Start with the dramatic question to grab the students' attention, then introduce the concept of Linux Containers (LXC). Use the analogy to help them understand the concept better and finally discuss its strengths and weaknesses.
- Analogy: Imagine a large kitchen where multiple chefs are working at the same time without messing up each other's dishes. They all have their own space, tools, and ingredients but share the same oven and refrigerator. LXC is like having these individual spaces within a single kitchen.

### Interactive Activities for Linux Containers (LXC)
 1. Debate Topic: "Linux Containers (LXC) should be universally adopted as the standard containerization method due to their ease of use for existing Linux users and resource efficiency, despite their limited portability outside of the Linux environment."

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine you are a system administrator tasked with setting up an application deployment pipeline for a large organization. The organization's infrastructure is primarily built on Windows servers, but they want to start using containerization to streamline their deployment process. Given the strengths and weaknesses of Linux Containers (LXC), should you recommend using LXC or look for another containerization solution that might be more compatible with their existing environment?"
