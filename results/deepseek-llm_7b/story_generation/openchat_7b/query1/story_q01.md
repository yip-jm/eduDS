## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
 ## The Story

### 1. The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time, in a bustling technology hub, a young engineer named Alice faced a big challenge. She was working on a project to manage multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, but the task seemed impossible. Her team had tried running different OSs on separate machines, but they were running out of space and resources.

### 2. The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while Alice was desperately searching for a solution, she stumbled upon an ancient artifact - the concept of Full Virtualization. This powerful technique allowed her to create virtual machines for each guest operating system, running on an operating system level and fully emulating the behavior of the underlying hardware. The virtualization layer provided isolation from other virtual machines, so they could run smoothly and without interfering with each other.

### 3. The Impact (Meaning)
Alice realized that Full Virtualization was a game-changer! It enabled her team to efficiently use hardware resources by running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. However, she also discovered that the performance could be affected by the complexity of the virtualization layer. Despite this minor drawback, Alice knew that Full Virtualization was a powerful solution that would revolutionize their project and save valuable resources.

## Storytelling Hooks
Dramatic Question: "What if you could run multiple operating systems on one machine without any of them knowing?"
Point of View: "From the perspective of an engineer tasked with managing multiple operating systems efficiently."

## Classroom Delivery Tips
Pacing: Pause after introducing the challenge to let students empathize with Alice's situation. Then, pause again when she discovers Full Virtualization to build suspense. Finally, pause at the end to reinforce the impact of this concept.
Analogy: Think of a busy kitchen where multiple chefs are preparing different dishes. Each chef (OS) has their own workspace (virtual machine), but they all share the same kitchen appliances and resources (hardware). This way, no dish or chef feels overcrowded or underutilized.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
 1. Debate Topic: "While full virtualization enables efficient utilization of hardware resources and allows for running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, it is debatable whether the potential performance impact due to the complexity of the virtualization layer outweighs these benefits."

2. What If Scenario Question: Imagine a scenario where you have been tasked with setting up a new server for a rapidly growing tech company. The company's requirements necessitate using full virtualization to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine. However, there is a possibility that this could lead to performance issues due to the complexity of the virtualization layer. In this situation, should you proceed with full virtualization or opt for alternative solutions that might provide better performance but require additional hardware resources? Justify your choice based on the trade-offs between efficiency and potential performance impact.

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event):
Once upon a time in a bustling data center, there were many servers running various operating systems. These servers had to be powerful and efficient to handle the heavy workload from thousands of users. But as more applications and services were added, managing these servers became increasingly difficult and resource-intensive. The IT team faced constant challenges trying to balance performance with resource allocation, and they desperately needed a solution.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):
One day, a brilliant IT engineer named Alex stumbled upon an innovative technology called "Para-Virtualization." In this new world, the Type 1 hypervisor was the all-knowing wizard who could modify the guest operating system's code and kernel. This allowed the guest operating systems to run on top of the hypervisor without needing to emulate all hardware components. The IT team was amazed; they had finally found a method that improved efficiency and performance, making their servers more powerful than ever before.

#### The Impact (Meaning):
Para-Virtualization quickly became the preferred choice for enterprise environments, as it offered better performance and efficiency compared to full virtualization. But there was a catch: guest operating systems needed to be modified, which sometimes led to compatibility issues. Despite this drawback, the benefits of Para-Virtualization were undeniable. The data center saw significant improvements in resource allocation and overall system performance, ensuring that their users enjoyed a smooth and efficient experience.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question:
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

#### Point of View:
From the perspective of a data center manager struggling to balance performance with resource allocation.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing:
- Pause after introducing the problem and challenge faced by the IT team.
- Slow down when explaining the concept of Para-Virtualization, highlighting its key points and how it works.
- Encourage questions and discussions during the explanation to ensure understanding.

#### Analogy:
Imagine you're hosting a large dinner party, and you need to serve different types of food to your guests. Full virtualization is like preparing each dish separately for every guest, while Para-Virtualization is like using common pots and pans for multiple dishes, making the process more efficient without compromising on quality or taste.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
 1. Debate Topic: "Para-Virtualization is a superior approach to virtualization because of its improved performance and efficiency, even though it requires modifying guest operating systems which may lead to compatibility issues."

2. What If Scenario Question: Imagine you are the chief technology officer (CTO) of a company that specializes in cloud computing. Your team has been tasked with choosing between full virtualization and para-virtualization for your cloud infrastructure. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of both, would you opt for para-virtualization despite the potential compatibility issues it may cause? Justify your choice based on the trade-offs involved.

### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a bustling city filled with towering skyscrapers and advanced technology, there was a company that needed to manage multiple computer systems efficiently but faced serious challenges with their existing infrastructure. They had many projects that required different operating systems, but managing all those systems on individual hardware was becoming a nightmare, both in terms of cost and efficiency.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, an engineer named Alex stumbled upon the concept of "Hardware-Supported Virtualisation." It was like magic! He learned that virtual machines were fully supported by the hardware, which improved their performance and efficiency. This was made possible through technologies such as Intel VT-d (Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O) and AMD-V (AMD Virtualization). The key point here was that since the support came directly from the hardware, it allowed virtual machines to be more efficient than software-based solutions.

### The Impact (Meaning)
By implementing hardware-supported virtualisation, Alex transformed the company's infrastructure into a powerful and efficient system. This solution was not only cost-effective but also provided better performance compared to software-based virtualisation. However, it is essential to note that the performance could vary depending on the specific hardware configuration.
