## Teaching Module: Grid computing
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

**The Problem (Event):** In the early 2000s, scientists at CERN were working on a massive simulation that would require more computational power than any single supercomputer could provide. They needed to figure out a way to distribute the workload across multiple computers in order to complete the simulation within the necessary timeframe.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):** One day, a brilliant physicist named Dr. Jane realized that they could pool together resources from different institutions and use distributed computing to share the processing of tasks. She introduced them to Grid computing, a paradigm that allowed for distributed workload handling through tools like MPI (Message Passing Interface). This allowed the scientists to aggregate and fairly distribute the combined compute resources across the participating institutions, solving their problem efficiently and effectively.

**The Impact (Meaning):** The concept of Grid computing turned out to be a game-changer for the scientific community. Its ability to share resource pools across different institutions enabled large-scale projects that would have been impossible with traditional single-supercomputer approaches. While there were some weaknesses, such as security and communication challenges, the strengths of Grid computing far outweighed them, making it an essential tool for future scientific advancements.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** Can a network of ordinary computers work together to solve problems that would be impossible for any single computer to tackle alone?

**Point of View:** From the perspective of a researcher facing a massive, resource-intensive simulation challenge.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing:** Pause after introducing the problem faced by scientists at CERN and again after mentioning the concept of Grid computing to allow students time to process the information. Ask a question to engage them in the discussion, such as "How do you think they could distribute the workload across multiple computers?"

**Analogy:** Imagine trying to build a large puzzle with many different pieces that each have unique shapes and colors. If you try to put the pieces together individually, it might take a long time and be very challenging. But if you gather a group of people to work together on finding the right pieces and putting them in their correct places, the process becomes much easier and faster. Similarly, Grid computing allows multiple computers to work together, pooling resources and sharing tasks to solve complex problems more efficiently than any single computer could alone.

### Interactive Activities for Grid computing
 1. Debate Topic: "Grid computing offers a more efficient way to handle large-scale data processing tasks compared to traditional computing methods, despite potential drawbacks such as security vulnerabilities and high energy consumption."

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a scenario where a major scientific research institution is tasked with processing an enormous amount of data for a groundbreaking project. They have the option to use grid computing or traditional computing methods. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of grid computing, which method would you recommend and why?"

 ## 1. The Story

### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a small town, a young entrepreneur named Sam wanted to start an online business. He needed a website, but he didn't have enough money to buy and maintain his own server. His friend Tom suggested that he should look into this new thing called "cloud computing."

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
Sam learned that cloud computing was a model for delivering on-demand computing resources, including hardware, software, storage, databases, networking, applications, and services over the internet with pay-per-use pricing. He discovered that he could access a wide range of computing resources whenever he needed them, without having to invest in expensive hardware and software upfront. Plus, he only paid for what he used.

### The Impact (Meaning)
Sam realized that cloud computing was the solution to his problem. It allowed him to scale his business easily by distributing processing across multiple servers. This made his website more reliable and faster, which helped him attract more customers and grow his business. However, Sam also learned about some weaknesses of cloud computing, such as potential security risks and data privacy concerns. But overall, he saw the significant advantages that cloud computing brought to his business.

## 2. Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question**: What if you could have access to unlimited computing resources without having to buy and maintain your own server?
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of a start-up founder trying to launch their first website.

## 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Start by introducing the concept of cloud computing, then share Sam's story, pausing after each key point to let students absorb the information and ask questions.
- **Analogy**: Imagine having a magic box that can provide any computer resource you need, like a genie granting wishes for your tech needs. That's what cloud computing is like!

### Interactive Activities for Cloud computing
 1. Debate Topic: "Cloud computing, despite its potential for increased efficiency and cost savings, poses significant security risks that can outweigh its benefits."
2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a world where all data is stored on a centralized cloud server instead of individual devices. How would this impact the privacy of users and what measures could be taken to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information?"

## Teaching Module: Resource control methods
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a faraway land called Computerville, there were two kingdoms - the Kingdom of Grid and the Kingdom of Cloud. Both kingdoms were facing challenges with their resources. In the Kingdom of Grid, researchers needed to share expensive computing resources across different institutions, but they struggled to manage access securely. Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Cloud, businesses were trying to predict how many resources they would need for their rapidly changing projects.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a wise sorceress named Resource Control appeared and taught them two powerful spells - X.509 access in Grid computing and pay-per-use elasticity in cloud computing. X.509 was a digital identity standard that allowed researchers to securely communicate with the resources they needed. Pay-per-use elasticity enabled businesses to scale their resources up or down based on demand, like a magical balancing act.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The sorceress's spells were transformative for both kingdoms. In the Kingdom of Grid, X.509 access allowed secure and efficient resource sharing, leading to groundbreaking research collaborations. In the Kingdom of Cloud, businesses could optimize their spending by only paying for the resources they actually used, which led to significant cost savings. These spells made the kingdoms more productive and innovative, proving that managing and optimizing resources is a powerful magic indeed.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question
What if you could control your computer's resources like a wizard, making them appear or disappear based on your needs?

#### Point of View
Imagine being an engineer in charge of managing resources for a rapidly growing company, constantly trying to find the perfect balance between cost and performance.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
#### Pacing
- Pause after introducing the Problem and before revealing the 'Aha!' Moment, to build suspense.
- Ask questions about the Key_Points during the story to keep students engaged and thinking critically.

#### Analogy
Think of resource control methods like a magical treasure chest that can only be opened by the right key (X.509 access in Grid computing) and contains items that appear and disappear based on your needs (Pay-per-use elasticity in cloud computing).

### Interactive Activities for Resource control methods
 1. **Debate Topic**: "Resource control methods should prioritize efficiency over fairness in order to maximize overall productivity."
2. **What If** Scenario Question: "Imagine a world where there is only one source of water, and two cities are dependent on it for their survival. One city has developed advanced technology that allows them to use the resource more efficiently while the other city uses the same amount of water but wastes a large portion of it. Should the water supply be controlled and distributed based on efficiency or equally divided between both cities despite the inefficiencies?"
