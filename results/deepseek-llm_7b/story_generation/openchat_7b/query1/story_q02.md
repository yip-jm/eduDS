## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a busy data center, there was an engineer named Sam who was struggling to manage the growing number of physical servers required to run different operating systems and applications. These servers were consuming valuable space, energy, and resources, and Sam knew there had to be a better way.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while exploring new technologies, Sam stumbled upon the concept of Full Virtualization. In this magical technique, all the hardware of the underlying device was fully simulated, providing a virtual machine that could run multiple operating systems on a single physical server. This was like having a powerful sorcerer who could create illusions of different worlds within the same room!

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Sam realized that Full Virtualization could be the solution to his problems. It increased resource utilization, provided flexibility for running diverse workloads, and enhanced compatibility among systems. However, there were trade-offs, as additional layers of abstraction could potentially slow down performance. Nevertheless, Sam understood the importance of this concept in modern data centers and cloud computing, and he couldn't wait to implement it.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
What if we could run multiple operating systems on a single computer without them interfering with each other?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer in a data center struggling to manage resources and compatibility issues among different systems.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing
- Pause after "The Problem" to allow students to think about the challenges faced by Sam.
- Pause again after "The 'Aha!' Moment" to let them digest the concept of Full Virtualization.
- Encourage questions and discussions after "The Impact" to explore its strengths, weaknesses, and significance in more detail.

#### Analogy
Imagine a magician with the power to create multiple realities within the same room, each with different rules and environments. This is similar to Full Virtualization, where one physical server can host multiple virtual machines running different operating systems without them interfering with each other.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
 1. Debate Topic: "While full virtualisation increases resource utilization, flexibility, and workload compatibility, is it worth the potential performance trade-offs due to additional layers of abstraction?"

2. What If Scenario Question: Imagine a company that is considering switching its entire IT infrastructure to a fully virtualised environment. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of full virtualisation, what would be your recommendation and why? Would you suggest they make this switch or stick with their current setup?

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
 ## 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

### The Problem (Event)
In a faraway land called Techtopia, engineers faced a significant challenge. They needed to run different operating systems on their machines simultaneously without affecting each other's performance or causing conflicts. However, they discovered that some operating systems were not compatible with their hardware resources and native device drivers. They needed a solution to improve compatibility while maintaining the efficiency of their machines.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a brilliant inventor named Para-Virtualizer introduced a groundbreaking method called "Para-Virtualisation." This new approach required modifying the guest operating system and using hooks to enhance machine execution simulation. By doing so, they could improve compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources without sacrificing performance.

### The Impact (Meaning)
The engineers quickly realized that Para-Virtualisation was a game-changer in their quest for seamless multi-operating system compatibility. While it required modifying the guest operating systems, it provided significant benefits. The improved compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources allowed the engineers to run multiple systems efficiently without compromising performance. However, they also understood that this method was more commonly used in enterprise environments due to its requirements.

## 2. Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question**: Can modifying an operating system make it work better with different hardware and drivers?
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of a struggling engineer in Techtopia who needs to find a way to run multiple operating systems without causing conflicts or performance issues.

## 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Start by introducing the challenge faced by engineers, then reveal Para-Virtualisation as the solution. Pause after each section for discussion or questions from students.
- **Analogy**: Imagine your computer is like a busy restaurant. The host (operating system) needs to manage different tables (hardware resources and device drivers) efficiently while still providing excellent service (performance). Para-Virtualisation acts as the head chef who modifies the menu to improve compatibility, making it easier for everyone to enjoy their meal (run multiple operating systems simultaneously) without any issues.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
 1. Debate Topic: "In the context of virtualization technology, should Para-Virtualisation be preferred over full virtualisation despite its requirement for modification of the guest operating system?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine you are a systems administrator tasked with setting up a virtual environment for your organization's IT needs. The organization's hardware is already configured to work optimally with native device drivers and hardware resources, but modifying the guest operating system for Para-Virtualisation could be time-consuming. Considering this scenario, would you choose Para-Virtualisation over full virtualisation, given its strengths and weaknesses?"

## Teaching Module: Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event): The IT Department of a Large Corporation Faced A Challenge
In a large corporation, the IT department was struggling to manage their increasing number of servers and software applications. They needed a solution that would allow them to run multiple operating systems on one physical server without any conflicts or decreased performance.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Discovery Of Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
One day, an IT engineer named Jane came across the concept of hardware-supported virtualisation. She discovered that this method fully simulates a specific type of hypervisor and enables multiple operating systems to run on one physical server. This was exactly what they needed!

#### The Impact (Meaning): Improved Performance And Better Resource Management
By implementing hardware-supported virtualisation, the corporation was able to improve their performance characteristics for specific hypervisor types while also better managing their resources. However, Jane realized that this approach had limited support and may not be as widely adopted as other types of virtualization. Despite its weaknesses, she understood that it still held significant importance in certain enterprise environments.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question**: What if you could run multiple operating systems on one physical server without any conflicts or decreased performance?
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of an IT engineer facing a challenge in managing server resources and applications.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: When introducing the concept, pause after mentioning that hardware-supported virtualisation fully simulates a specific type of hypervisor and enables multiple operating systems to run on one physical server. Ask the students if they can guess why this would be helpful.
- **Analogy**: Imagine you have a toy box that can fit different types of toys, but each toy has its own special way of fitting into the box. Hardware-supported virtualisation is like having a magical box that can fit all kinds of toys together without them getting mixed up or damaged.

### Interactive Activities for Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
 1. Debate Topic: "Hardware-Supported Virtualization provides better performance for specific hypervisor types, but is it worth choosing over software-based virtualization due to its limited support and lack of widespread adoption?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "In a situation where you need to set up a data center to host critical applications, would you choose Hardware-Supported Virtualization over Software-Based Virtualization? Justify your choice considering the trade-offs between performance characteristics and support."
