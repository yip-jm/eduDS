## Teaching Module: Grid computing
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
**The Problem (Event)**: In a world where big data and complex simulations are becoming increasingly important, scientists and researchers were struggling to find ways to process vast amounts of information quickly and efficiently. They were facing interoperability issues among different nodes, and managing resources was proving to be a challenge.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Then, they discovered the concept of grid computing. This distributed computing paradigm allowed them to share processing resources across a network of multiple nodes, which were connected via tools like MPI (Message Passing Interface). They could now share data among different nodes and use their collective power to perform large-scale data analysis and simulations.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Grid computing was a powerful tool that helped them efficiently use resources, making it ideal for big data analysis and simulations. However, they soon realized it came with limitations such as interoperability issues among different nodes and resource management challenges due to the heterogeneity of participating institutions. Despite these trade-offs, grid computing remained a valuable solution for tackling large-scale computations.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
**Dramatic Question**: What if we could harness the combined power of thousands of computers around the world to solve complex problems and analyze massive data sets?

**Point of View**: From the perspective of a scientist working on a project that requires processing large amounts of data, struggling with resource limitations and interoperability issues.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
**Pacing**: Pause after introducing the problem faced by scientists, after describing the discovery of grid computing, and before discussing its importance and trade-offs. This will give students time to absorb the information and ask questions if needed.

**Analogy**: Imagine a group of ants working together to carry a large piece of food back to their colony. Each ant represents a computer in the grid, and the food is the data that needs to be processed. By working together and sharing resources, they can move the food (data) much faster than if each ant tried to do it alone.

### Interactive Activities for Grid computing

## Teaching Module: Pay-per-use elasticity
 ## The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a faraway land called Techville, there was a small company that needed to process large amounts of data every day. They had to use a powerful computer system for this, but the problem was that they could never predict how much processing power they would need. Sometimes they used more than they expected and other times less, which led to either wasteful spending or insufficient resources. This situation created a challenge for their budget and efficiency.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while searching for solutions, the company discovered something amazing called "Pay-per-use elasticity." In this innovative model, they only had to pay for the computing resources they actually used! Moreover, they could easily scale up or down according to their needs. This was a feature of cloud computing that offered flexibility and cost efficiency, unlike traditional grid systems where everything had to be pre-planned and static.

### The Impact (Meaning)
With this new concept, the company finally found a solution to their problem. They could now adapt their computing resources according to their needs at any given time without worrying about wasting money on unused resources or not having enough for peak times. This made them more flexible and cost-efficient than ever before. While there were no direct weaknesses mentioned, it's important to remember that every solution comes with trade-offs; however, in this case, the benefits far outweighed any potential drawbacks.

## Storytelling Hooks
### Dramatic Question
"What if you could have a computer system that grows and shrinks according to your needs, rather than being stuck with a fixed amount of resources?"

### Point of View
Imagine the perspective of an overworked IT manager who has been struggling with managing their company's computing resources. They are constantly faced with the challenge of predicting future demands while trying to keep costs low.

## Classroom Delivery Tips
### Pacing
Pause after introducing the problem, then again when presenting the solution (Pay-per-use elasticity). Ask questions like "How do you think they could solve this problem?" or "What kind of resources might they need?" to engage students and get them thinking. Finally, pause at the end of the story when discussing its importance.

### Analogy
Think of a water park where visitors pay for the rides they use instead of buying an all-access pass. This way, they only spend money on what they enjoy, making it more cost-efficient and enjoyable for them. Similarly, Pay-per-use elasticity allows users to pay only for the resources they actually need, providing flexibility and cost efficiency in cloud computing.

### Interactive Activities for Pay-per-use elasticity
 1. **Debate Topic**: "In a world of growing environmental concerns and budget constraints, should businesses prioritize the adoption of pay-per-use elasticity models over traditional pricing structures?"

2. **What If' Scenario Question**: "Imagine a company that has just implemented a pay-per-use elasticity model for its products. A sudden increase in demand requires them to ramp up production and resources quickly. What if the company's production capabilities are unable to keep up with the demand? How would they justify their choice of adopting this flexible pricing model, considering the potential drawbacks it might have caused?"
