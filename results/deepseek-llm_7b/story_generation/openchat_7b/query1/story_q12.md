## Teaching Module: Identity and Access Management (IAM)
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a faraway land called Cloud City, there was a kingdom where all the data and resources were stored on large servers, accessible to anyone who knew how to find them. One day, a cunning thief managed to break into the palace and stole valuable information that could have caused chaos throughout the land.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
The King was very worried about this incident and asked his wise advisor for help. The wise advisor told him about a magical framework called Identity and Access Management (IAM). This framework, he explained, controlled who could access what in the kingdom by managing identities, roles, permissions, and authentication processes. Only those with the right identity and role could enter the palace gates, and they had to prove their identity using a secret password or token before being granted access.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The implementation of IAM brought peace back to Cloud City. Now, only authorized users could access sensitive information, making it much harder for thieves like the cunning one to steal valuable data. While there were some limitations and potential weaknesses in the system, such as human errors or breaches due to weak authentication methods, the overall benefits far outweighed these risks. IAM was crucial in securing the kingdom's most precious resources, ensuring that only those who deserved access could get it.

- **Dramatic Question**: How can we protect our digital palace from thieves and ensure only trusted subjects gain entry?
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of a brave knight guarding the gates of Cloud City, tasked with ensuring only authorized individuals enter.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Begin by describing the problem, then move to the discovery of IAM and its workings. Finally, discuss why it's important and pause for questions after each section.
- **Analogy**: Imagine a castle with a drawbridge that only lowers for specific guests who have been identified and given a secret password or token.

### Interactive Activities for Identity and Access Management (IAM)
 1. Debate Topic: "While Identity and Access Management (IAM) is essential for maintaining security in an organization, it can also hinder productivity by adding complexity to user authentication processes. Should organizations prioritize IAM efficiency over the potential risks associated with a less secure system?"

2. What If Scenario Question: Imagine a company that has recently adopted a new cloud-based platform. The Identity and Access Management (IAM) setup for this platform requires users to go through multiple steps to authenticate themselves, which has significantly increased security but also decreased employee productivity due to the extra time spent on these processes. What if the company decides to simplify the IAM process by reducing the number of authentication steps? Discuss and justify your choice based on the trade-offs between security and efficiency in the context of Identity and Access Management (IAM).
