## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
 ## 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a bustling data center, there were many servers running diverse operating systems. They were all powerful but required a lot of space and energy to operate. The data center manager, Mr. Green, was worried as he couldn't afford to buy more physical servers for each operating system. He needed a solution that would allow him to use his resources efficiently without compromising on workload compatibility.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a brilliant young technician named Alice came up with an idea. She proposed using something called "Full Virtualization." This was a new concept where all the hardware of the underlying device would be fully simulated and provided a virtual machine. It could emulate the behavior and performance characteristics of the physical hardware, allowing multiple operating systems to run on one physical server.

### The Impact (Meaning)
Alice's Full Virtualization solution was a game-changer for Mr. Green and his data center. It increased resource utilization, flexibility, and workload compatibility without compromising on performance. However, there were some trade-offs as well, like potential performance issues due to additional layers of abstraction. But overall, the advantages outweighed the drawbacks, making it an essential technique in modern data centers and cloud computing.

## 2. Storytelling Hooks
### Dramatic Question
Could simulating a computer's intelligence make it more efficient and versatile?

### Point of View
From the perspective of a data center manager struggling to manage diverse operating systems on limited resources.

## 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
### Pacing
Pause after introducing the problem to allow students to absorb the situation. Then, pause again after explaining Full Virtualization to let them process the concept. Ask questions during the Impact section to encourage critical thinking.

### Analogy
Think of a car factory where each car is made on a single production line. Full Virtualization is like having one assembly line that can build different types of cars (operating systems) without needing separate lines for each type, making better use of space and resources.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
 1. **Debate Topic:** "Full Virtualisation can lead to increased resource utilization and flexibility, but may result in performance trade-offs due to additional layers of abstraction. Should companies prioritize the benefits or focus more on the potential drawbacks?"

2. **What If' Scenario Question:** "Imagine a company is considering implementing full virtualisation for their data center operations. The CEO has two options - Option A, where they invest in more powerful hardware to compensate for any performance trade-offs; and Option B, where they stick with the current hardware setup without any upgrades. Which option would you recommend and why?"

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a bustling city, there was a large corporation that was trying to manage their growing number of computers and devices. Each device had its own operating system, which was like a language that the computer understood to perform tasks. But as the company grew, it became harder and harder for them to keep all these devices working smoothly together.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a brilliant engineer named Alex discovered a new method of virtualisation called "Para-virtualisation". In this method, the guest operating system, or the language of each device, was modified to use a set of special hooks that allowed for better simulation of machine execution. These hooks were like invisible bridges that connected different devices and helped them understand each other's languages more efficiently.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
By using Para-virtualisation, Alex was able to improve the compatibility between the guest operating systems and the native device drivers and hardware resources. This made it easier for all the computers in the corporation to work together seamlessly. However, modifying the guest operating system also meant that each device needed to be reprogrammed with these new hooks, which could be a challenge for some. Despite this drawback, Para-virtualisation was incredibly valuable in enterprise environments like the corporation, where compatibility and efficiency were crucial.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question:
Could making computers "dumber" actually make them smarter by improving their ability to work together?

#### Point of View:
From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in managing a vast network of computers and devices.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing:
- When introducing Para-virtualisation, pause after "Para-virtualisation is enabled by Type1 Hypervisors." to allow students to absorb the information.
- Ask a question like, "What do you think happens when we modify the guest operating system?" after mentioning that it requires modification. This encourages student engagement and understanding.

#### Analogy:
Think of each computer as a person in a team, and the operating systems as their individual languages. Para-virtualisation is like teaching everyone on the team to understand a common set of words or phrases, making communication much easier and more efficient for the entire group.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
 1. Debate Topic: "Para-Virtualization offers better compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources; however, its requirement of modifying the guest operating system can be seen as a significant disadvantage. Should we prioritize compatibility over ease of use and security, or should we focus on simplifying the implementation process to promote greater adoption of virtualization technologies?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a company that needs to migrate its existing applications from physical servers to virtual machines for better resource management and cost efficiency. Given the choice between Para-Virtualization, which provides excellent compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources but requires modifying the guest operating system, and Full Virtualization, which allows using existing operating systems without modification but may have limited hardware compatibility, which option would be more suitable and why?"

## Teaching Module: Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
**The Problem (Event):** In a large corporation, many different departments had their own servers running various operating systems. This led to inefficiencies and higher costs due to the need for physical space, energy consumption, and maintenance for all these separate machines.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):** An IT manager discovered hardware-supported virtualisation. It was a method of virtualisation that fully simulates all the features of a specific type of hypervisor. This meant it could emulate the behaviour and performance characteristics of the hardware, allowing multiple operating systems to run on one physical server.

**The Impact (Meaning):** Hardware-supported virtualisation provided a solution for the IT manager's challenge. It offered better performance characteristics for specific hypervisor types, which was crucial in enterprise environments. However, it had limited support and may not be as widely adopted as other types of virtualization. Despite its limitations, the manager realized that this approach could significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency by running multiple operating systems on a single server.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question:** "What if you could run multiple operating systems simultaneously on just one physical server?"
- **Point of View:** "From the perspective of an IT manager tasked with reducing costs and improving efficiency."

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing:** Pause after presenting the problem to let students think about potential solutions. Pause again after introducing hardware-supported virtualisation to discuss its key points. Pause once more at the end of the story to ask if they can think of any other ways to solve the problem.
- **Analogy:** Imagine you have a kitchen filled with different appliances for making various types of food. Hardware-supported virtualisation is like having a single, powerful blender that can mix and blend ingredients for multiple dishes at once, saving space and time in your kitchen.

### Interactive Activities for Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
 1. Debate Topic: "Hardware-Supported Virtualisation, despite its limited support and wider adoption issues, should be preferred over other virtualization methods due to its potential for better performance characteristics in specific hypervisor types."

2. What If Scenario Question: Imagine a situation where a company has two options for setting up their data center: one using hardware-supported virtualisation and another using software-based virtualisation. The company's primary goal is to maximize the performance of its operations, but they are aware of the potential limitations of hardware-supported virtualisation. Based on this scenario, discuss whether or not the company should opt for hardware-supported virtualisation despite its limited support and wider adoption issues. Justify your choice by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of both options in relation to performance characteristics for specific hypervisor types.
