## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event): Before the Shared Responsibility Model
Once upon a time in the land of cloud computing, there were many users who stored their data and applications on large, powerful servers provided by a mysterious entity called "the Cloud". These users felt safe because they believed that the Cloud was responsible for protecting everything they stored. But one day, a terrible security breach occurred, causing chaos among the users.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Discovering the Shared Responsibility Model
As the users and their engineers scrambled to understand what went wrong, they realized that the responsibility for securing data and applications was not as clearly divided as they had thought. They learned about a magical concept called the "Shared Responsibility Model". This model defined three categories of responsibility: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

- **In IaaS**, users were responsible for securing their data, applications, and infrastructure. The cloud service provider was only responsible for the security of the underlying cloud infrastructure, such as servers, storage, networking, etc.
- In **PaaS**, users were responsible for securing their applications and data. The provider took care of the infrastructure but left the users to manage the security of their applications.
- In **SaaS**, the provider was responsible for all aspects of the cloud service, including security. However, users still needed to ensure the security of their data.

#### The Impact (Meaning): Why Shared Responsibility Matters
The Shared Responsibility Model brought clarity and understanding to the relationship between users and providers. It highlighted that both parties had a role in securing the cloud environment. This model helped users realize that they could not simply rely on the cloud provider for all security measures, and it made them more vigilant about their own responsibilities.

- **Strengths**: The model provides clarity on who is responsible for what, which helps avoid confusion and potential misunderstandings between users and providers. It also encourages collaboration and shared effort in ensuring the security of data and applications.
- **Weaknesses**: The model can create some ambiguity about where exactly the line is drawn between user responsibility and provider responsibility. This could potentially lead to gaps in security if not managed properly.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question:
Could a misunderstanding of the Shared Responsibility Model lead to catastrophic consequences for users' data and applications?

#### Point of View:
From the perspective of a cloud user who is trying to understand their responsibility in securing their data and applications.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
#### Pacing:
- Pause after introducing the Problem to allow students to empathize with the users facing the security breach.
- Pause again after the 'Aha!' Moment to let them absorb the concept of Shared Responsibility Model.
- Pause once more during the Impact section to discuss the strengths and weaknesses, encouraging student participation in a debate about the model's pros and cons.

#### Analogy:
Imagine your home is protected by a security system, but you also have a personal alarm that you are responsible for using correctly. The cloud provider is like the professional security company, and users are like homeowners who must use their alarms properly to ensure full security.

### Interactive Activities for Shared Responsibility Model
 1. Debate Topic: "While the Shared Responsibility Model encourages collaboration and collective decision-making, it may lead to groupthink and a lack of individual accountability. Should this model be adopted in all aspects of society?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine you are part of a team working on a critical project with a tight deadline. The Shared Responsibility Model is being applied, but one member of the team is not pulling their weight. How would you handle this situation, and what trade-offs would you consider between maintaining collaboration and ensuring individual accountability?"

## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a bustling tech town called Cloudville, there was a major security breach at the largest data center, DataMountain. Sensitive information about the town's residents was leaked, causing chaos and fear among its people. The mayor demanded an immediate solution to prevent future incidents and protect their digital assets.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
The town's brilliant IT specialist, Alice, discovered a concept called Identity/Access Management (IAM). It was a process that controlled user access to resources within the cloud environment by managing identities and permissions. IAM ensured only authorized users could access the data they needed, like having a digital doorman for DataMountain!

Alice explained how IAM worked: it's critical for maintaining security in cloud environments. She mentioned AWS IAM, Azure AD, and GCP Identity as examples of identity management services that help protect the town's information from unauthorized access.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The concept of IAM was a game-changer for Cloudville. It provided strong security measures to prevent future breaches like the one at DataMountain. Alice highlighted the strengths of IAM, such as its ability to manage access control and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. However, she also discussed its weaknesses, like requiring continuous maintenance and potential vulnerabilities if not set up correctly.

Alice emphasized the importance of IAM for maintaining the town's security in the digital age and how it could save Cloudville from similar disasters in the future. She concluded that although there might be trade-offs, the benefits of IAM far outweighed its drawbacks.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question:
What if a single key could unlock all the secrets of the digital world, but also put them all at risk?
