## Teaching Module: Microservices
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a bustling city filled with skyscrapers and technology giants, there was a small startup company called "FastTech". FastTech developed innovative applications to make everyday life easier for millions of users. But as their user base grew, so did the complexity of their applications. Their monolithic architecture, where all components were tightly coupled and dependent on each other, began to falter under the weight of its own success.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a wise mentor visited FastTech and heard about their troubles. He suggested that they should look into Microservices - a software development approach where an application is structured as a collection of small, independent services. Each service would be responsible for a specific business capability and communicate with other services through APIs. This way, the services could evolve independently, enabling faster deployment and scaling of individual components.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
As FastTech implemented Microservices, they found that it not only solved their scalability issues but also made their system more agile and resilient. They could now easily add or remove features without disrupting the entire application. Moreover, the team could work on different services in parallel, accelerating development and responding to evolving business requirements with greater flexibility. While Microservices had its trade-offs, like managing a network of interconnected services, FastTech appreciated the benefits it brought to their growing company.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question:
