## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
### The Story

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine a bustling city where everyone is rushing to get their work done and protect their treasures—whether it's documents, photos, or sensitive data. In this city, two groups are in charge: the city council responsible for maintaining the streets, bridges, and public safety; and the citizens who own their homes and businesses, manage their keys, and secure their personal belongings. This scenario is quite similar to what happens with cloud services—cloud users (citizens) and cloud service providers (city council).

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a young engineer named Alex noticed that some citizens were struggling to protect their data while using the city's internet infrastructure. Alex realized this wasn't just about securing personal keys but also about understanding who was responsible for what. Cloud services are like a modern city with different levels of responsibility—some things are managed by the cloud service provider (the city council), and others must be handled by the users themselves.

In the world of cloud computing, the shared responsibility model divides security into three categories:
1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: This is like the streets and bridges in our city example—cloud service providers are responsible for securing these underlying resources.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Similar to the buildings and safety measures, where both cloud users and providers share some responsibilities.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: This is like the personal belongings inside each home; users handle most of the security here.

Alex's 'aha!' moment came when he understood that just like in our city example, everyone has to do their part to keep everything secure. By working together and understanding who is responsible for what, they can create a safer environment for all.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
This shared responsibility model matters because it ensures security doesn't fall through the cracks. Cloud users are still responsible for securing their data, applications, and infrastructure—just like citizens must keep an eye on their personal belongings in our city analogy. On the other hand, cloud service providers take care of the underlying infrastructure, ensuring that the streets (servers), bridges (networking), and public safety measures (firewalls) are secure.

The shared responsibility model is a practical solution because it distributes security tasks efficiently between users and providers. However, this distribution means there's potential for confusion about who should do what, which can lead to vulnerabilities if not managed properly. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of this model helps in making informed decisions on how to best protect data and applications.

### Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
"Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?"

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge, Alex must navigate the complexities of cloud security by understanding who is responsible for what.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**:
  - Pause after introducing the problem to let students think about their own experiences with securing personal information.
  - Ask: "Can you think of any instances where your personal data was compromised?"
  - After explaining the shared responsibility model, pause again and ask for examples from IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.

- **Analogy**:
  Provide a simple analogy by comparing cloud services to renting an apartment. The landlord (cloud provider) is responsible for maintaining the building's structure and common areas, while the tenant (user) is responsible for locking their own door and managing personal belongings inside.

By using this story, students can better understand the shared responsibility model in cloud computing through relatable examples and clear explanations of responsibilities.

### Interactive Activities for Shared Responsibility Model
### 1. Debate Topic

**Topic:** "Is the Shared Responsibility Model an Equitable Framework or Does It Inevitably Lead to Unfair Outcomes?"

**Argument for Strengths:**
- The Shared Responsibility Model encourages all parties involved—government, businesses, and individuals—to contribute equally towards achieving a common goal.
- This model can lead to more sustainable outcomes as it distributes the burden of responsibility across multiple sectors.

**Counterargument for Weaknesses:**
- If not properly balanced, this model might unfairly shift too much of the burden onto certain groups, particularly vulnerable populations or small businesses that may lack the resources to contribute equally.
- The complexity and ambiguity in defining responsibilities can lead to inequitable outcomes where some stakeholders benefit disproportionately while others are overburdened.

### 2. What If Scenario Question

**Scenario:**
Imagine a small coastal town facing severe flooding due to rising sea levels caused by climate change. The local government, businesses, and community members have decided to adopt the Shared Responsibility Model to address this issue. Each group is tasked with contributing resources and efforts towards flood mitigation.

**Question:** 
Given that the town's economy relies heavily on tourism and fishing, which are both at risk due to rising sea levels, how should the shared responsibility be distributed among government, businesses, and community members? Justify your distribution plan based on the potential strengths and weaknesses of the Shared Responsibility Model in this context.

**Discussion Points:**
- How can the model ensure that all parties contribute fairly without overburdening any one group?
- What measures could be put in place to support vulnerable groups such as small business owners who might struggle to meet their assigned responsibilities?
- Considering the strengths and weaknesses, how can this model help achieve a more equitable outcome for the town's residents and businesses?

## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management
### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine you're running a bustling online bookstore with thousands of books and customer accounts. Suddenly, one day, unauthorized access leads to sensitive information being shared without permission—customer credit card details, personal addresses, and even the book ratings that your marketing team relies on for strategic decisions. This breach not only compromises security but also potentially costs your business in terms of reputation and financial loss.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
In walks a tech-savvy wizard named Identity, who introduces you to the concept of Identity/Access Management (IAM). IAM is like having a magical lock that only opens when the right key (identity) and password (permissions) are used. AWS IAM, Azure AD, and GCP Identity are examples of these powerful wizards, each equipped with spells to control who can enter your castle and what they can do once inside.

IAM works by managing identities and permissions in a cloud environment. It ensures that only authorized users can access the data they need, much like how you might restrict certain areas of your bookstore to employees while allowing customers to browse freely. This process is critical for maintaining security because it minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and helps prevent sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The impact of IAM is profound. It not only secures your castle but also makes sure that every part of the business runs smoothly. By clearly defining who can do what, you reduce the chance of accidental or malicious breaches. However, while IAM greatly enhances security, it requires careful management to balance between too restrictive and overly permissive access controls.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

- **Dramatic Question**: "Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter by ensuring only authorized users can do certain things?"
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in maintaining security while allowing necessary access for operations.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Begin with the dramatic question, then introduce the scenario (problem). Pause here to allow students to think about how they would approach this problem.
- **Analogy**: Use the bookstore analogy: "Imagine your online bookstore is like a grand castle with many rooms and treasures. IAM acts as a magical doorkeeper who ensures only those with the right keys can enter certain areas."
- **Engagement**: Encourage students to imagine what other scenarios might benefit from IAM, such as managing access in schools or hospitals.
- **Discussion**: After sharing the story, ask: "How would you design an IAM system for your online bookstore? What identities and permissions would be necessary?"

### Interactive Activities for Identity/Access Management
### 1. Debate Topic

**Debate Topic:**
"Is Identity/Access Management solely beneficial or does it come with significant drawbacks?"

**Arguments for Proponents (Strengths):**

## Teaching Module: Data Protection Responsibilities
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

**The Problem (Event)**:
Imagine a small startup company that has just moved all its data and operations into the cloud. They thought they were making smart decisions by leveraging the latest technology to store and process their sensitive customer information, including financial details and personal records. However, as time passed, they began to notice breaches in security. Customer data started leaking, causing reputational damage, potential legal issues, and financial losses.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**:
One day, the company's IT manager, Alex, was reviewing a cloud service provider’s (CSP) report on recent updates. The report detailed improvements in infrastructure security but also highlighted that data protection responsibilities were shifting towards the user. Alex realized that while the CSP had beefed up its underlying cloud infrastructure, the startup still needed to take significant measures to protect their own data.

This realization came as a surprise because it meant that despite the CSP’s efforts, the company was now responsible for securing all the data stored on this platform. The concept of "Data Protection Responsibilities" began to unfold: For Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) models, users are primarily in charge of safeguarding their own information.

For IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, the CSP ensures that the underlying cloud infrastructure is secure. However, the user needs to implement security measures such as firewalls, encryption, and access controls on top of this secure foundation. The key points were clear: while the CSP must maintain a safe environment, users need to actively protect their data within it.

**The Impact (Meaning)**:
Understanding that both cloud users and service providers share responsibilities in protecting data is crucial for any organization moving its operations online. This concept not only clarifies who is responsible but also highlights the importance of collaboration between the two parties. For instance, while a CSP can prevent unauthorized access to their infrastructure, it's up to the user to ensure that they don't expose sensitive data through poor security practices.

The significance lies in the balance of security and responsibility. On one hand, users must be vigilant about securing their own data. On the other hand, cloud providers need to provide a secure environment for their customers. This partnership is vital for maintaining trust and ensuring compliance with regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA.

### Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**: 
"Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?"

**Point of View**: 
From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge, navigating the complex landscape of cloud security can be overwhelming. Understanding that both parties have distinct roles in protecting data is like finding the right balance between two opposing forces.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Start with the problem to build tension: "Imagine this scenario..." Pause briefly here to allow students to reflect.
- **Analogy**: Use the analogy of a house where the foundation (cloud infrastructure) is strong, but it's up to the homeowner (user) to lock the doors and windows (implement security measures). Ask, "How would you ensure your data stays safe in this scenario?"
- **Pause for Questions**: After explaining IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS models, pause to ask, "Can anyone think of an example where they might use each type?" 
- **Wrap-Up**: Summarize the concept by reiterating that while CSPs provide a secure environment, users need to take active steps in protecting their data. Emphasize the importance of collaboration and shared responsibility.

This approach helps students grasp the core idea through relatable examples and practical analogies, making the complex topic more digestible and engaging.

### Interactive Activities for Data Protection Responsibilities
### 1. Debate Topic

**Topic:** "Should data protection responsibilities be solely the responsibility of technology companies or should individuals also bear significant obligations in protecting their personal data?"
