This would ensure only authorized individuals accessed sensitive information, solving the security problem by establishing trust through verifiable credentials.

In parallel, Alex explored how cloud resources could be dynamically allocated based on real-time demand. The Pay-per-use elasticity model offered a solution where computing power could scale up or down as needed. This approach meant that during peak times, more servers were activated to handle increased load, and during low-usage periods, they were scaled back, optimizing both performance and cost.

### The Impact (Meaning)
The introduction of these resource control methods transformed the company's operations. With X.509 access, Grid systems became much more secure, as unauthorized access was significantly reduced, creating a safer environment for data exchanges. Meanwhile, Pay-per-use elasticity in Cloud computing brought about financial savings and improved performance by aligning resources with actual demand.

While these methods had strengths like enhanced security and cost efficiency, they also came with challenges such as the complexity of managing digital identities or the need for sophisticated monitoring tools to effectively implement scaling strategies. Nevertheless, their overall impact was profound: the company could now handle its computing needs more efficiently and securely than ever before.
