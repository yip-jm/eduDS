## Teaching Module: CI/CD
## The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

### The Problem (Event)
In the bustling city of Techville, software development teams worked tirelessly in separate silos—developers focused on writing code and operations teams handled deployments manually. This separation led to significant delays, frequent errors, and poor collaboration between developers and operations teams. As a result, product releases were infrequent, bugs were common, and customer satisfaction was low. The city's tech companies struggled to keep up with market demands, and the frustration was palpable.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, an insightful engineer named Alex decided to re-evaluate how his team approached software development. He discovered a methodology that promised to revolutionize their process: Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). CI encouraged developers to integrate their code changes into a shared repository frequently—often after every commit—and run automated tests to ensure new features or bug fixes worked as expected.

Alex explained, "By integrating our work more often, we can catch issues early. Automated testing will help us maintain high-quality standards without manual intervention."

With the success of CI in place, Alex introduced Continuous Delivery (CD). This process automatically deployed code that passed all tests to production environments for further testing and user access. The team was amazed at how seamlessly their work transitioned from development to deployment.

### The Impact (Meaning)
The implementation of CI/CD had a profound impact on the teams in Techville. They began delivering software faster, improved collaboration across departments, and experienced increased reliability due to fewer errors.
