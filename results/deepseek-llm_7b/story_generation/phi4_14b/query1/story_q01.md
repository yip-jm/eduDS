## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
In the bustling city of Technopolis, businesses were expanding rapidly and required more computing power than ever before. Each company had its own physical servers, which took up considerable space and consumed a lot of energy. This not only drove up costs but also created logistical nightmares with maintenance and security management. The challenge was clear: how could companies make better use of their existing hardware to run multiple systems efficiently?

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, an innovative engineer named Alex discovered something remarkable while working on a complex project. He realized that by simulating the entire hardware of a computer in software, he could create virtual machines that acted as separate computers running on a single physical machine. This technique was known as Full Virtualisation.

Alex explained to his team: "We can fully emulate the behavior of underlying hardware at the operating system level. By creating virtual machines for each guest operating system, we provide complete isolation from one another." The team marveled at how this could allow different systems to coexist on a single piece of hardware without interfering with each other. However, Alex also noted that while this was revolutionary, it came with its own challenges—the complexity of the virtualization layer could impact performance.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The adoption of Full Virtualisation transformed Technopolis. Companies were now able to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, leading to efficient utilization of hardware resources and significant cost savings. It enabled resource pooling, where different departments or applications within the same organization could share the same physical infrastructure without compromising security or performance.

However, Alex and his team remained mindful of the trade-offs. They continuously worked on optimizing the virtualization layer to minimize its impact on system performance. Despite these challenges, Full Virtualisation became a cornerstone of modern computing in Technopolis, showcasing how making hardware smarter through software could revolutionize technology use.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

- **Dramatic Question**: "Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?"
  
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of an engineer facing the challenge of maximizing limited computing resources in a rapidly growing city.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**:
  - Pause after describing Technopolis's problem to let students consider the challenges businesses face with physical servers.
  - Ask, "What if you could run multiple systems on one computer? How might that change things?" before introducing Full Virtualisation.

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
## The Story: Para-Virtualisation

### The Problem (Event)
In a bustling enterprise environment filled with servers running various applications, efficiency and performance were paramount yet elusive goals. These servers operated using traditional full virtualization methods where each guest operating system emulated hardware components to run independently. This method consumed significant resources, leading to inefficiencies and slower performance, especially when the demand on these systems increased.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a brilliant engineer named Alex faced this challenge head-on while working with Type 1 Hypervisors at VMware. Frustrated by the constant resource drain, Alex envisioned an innovative solution: para-virtualization. Unlike full virtualization, para-virtualization allowed guest operating systems to be modified directly at their core—specifically, their code and kernel—to communicate efficiently with a hypervisor like VMware ESXi.

This approach meant that the guest operating systems didn't need to waste resources emulating all hardware components, as they could leverage the hypervisor's capabilities. Instead of pretending to run on separate physical machines, these modified systems worked in harmony with the hypervisor, resulting in enhanced performance and resource management.

### The Impact (Meaning)
The impact of Alex’s discovery was profound. Para-virtualization brought about better performance and efficiency compared to full virtualization, which was a game-changer for enterprise environments dealing with high demand workloads. Organizations could now run multiple systems more effectively on the same hardware, saving costs and improving speed.

However, this innovation also came with challenges. The need to modify guest operating systems meant potential compatibility issues, requiring ongoing maintenance and updates. Despite these hurdles, the trade-off was worthwhile for many enterprises seeking optimized performance in their IT infrastructure.
