## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
**The Story**

### The Problem (Event)

In the bustling metropolis of CyberCity, the IT department of a large corporation was facing a nightmare scenario. Their servers were old and outdated, with different operating systems running on each one. This meant that they couldn't share resources efficiently, leading to wasted space, increased energy consumption, and difficulty in deploying new applications.

Imagine walking into a crowded office, where each employee works from their own separate desk, with their own unique set of tools and software. It's chaotic, inefficient, and expensive. This was the reality for CyberCity's IT team until they discovered a solution that would change everything: full virtualization.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)

One fateful day, a brilliant engineer named Max stumbled upon an innovative technique while working late one night. He realized that by creating a virtual machine on each server, he could mimic the behavior of actual hardware. This way, multiple operating systems could run side by side on the same physical server without interfering with each other.

Max was amazed at how seamlessly this new method worked. The servers were no longer like separate offices; they had transformed into virtual rooms where different "residents" (operating systems) lived harmoniously together. Each resident could use and share resources as needed, just like neighbors sharing a backyard.

### The Impact (Meaning)

With full virtualization in place, CyberCity's IT team was able to efficiently manage their servers, significantly increasing resource utilization. They could now deploy diverse workloads that were previously incompatible with each other, making it easier to adapt to changing business needs. The corporation saved on energy consumption and reduced the need for physical hardware upgrades.

However, as Max soon discovered, this new efficiency came at a cost. With more layers of abstraction, there was a risk of performance trade-offs. It required careful management and configuration to ensure that each virtual machine performed optimally. Despite these challenges, the benefits far outweighed the costs, making full virtualization an essential tool in modern data centers and cloud computing.

**Storytelling Hooks**

### Dramatic Question

Could simplifying how computers interact with hardware actually make them more powerful?

### Point of View

This story is told from the perspective of Max, the engineer who discovered the power of full virtualization. His journey from problem to solution offers a relatable and engaging narrative for students.

**Classroom Delivery Tips**

### Pacing

- Pause after describing the chaos of separate offices to ask: "How would you describe an environment where each unit operates independently?"
- Stop before explaining how virtual machines work to inquire: "What if we told you there was a way to make these units work together seamlessly?"

### Analogy

Use the analogy of a high-rise building with multiple tenants. Each floor (or server) can be thought of as having its own unique operating system, just like different floors in a building might have distinct businesses or residents. With full virtualization, each floor can now share resources and facilities without interference, just as tenants in an actual building would use shared spaces.

This analogy can help students visualize the concept more easily, making it a memorable part of their learning experience.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
**Debate Topic: "Is Full Virtualization Worth the Performance Trade-Offs?"**

This debate topic presents a clear, debatable statement that pits the strengths against the weaknesses of full virtualization.

*   **Affirmative Team:** Argue that the benefits of increased resource utilization, flexibility, and workload compatibility outweigh the potential performance trade-offs.
*   **Negative Team:** Counter with evidence that the additional layers of abstraction required for full virtualization can lead to decreased performance and undermine its advantages.

**What If Scenario Question: "Managing a Critical Application"**

Imagine a scenario where your organization relies on a critical application that requires real-time data processing. However, this application is about to experience a significant surge in traffic due to an upcoming event.

*   **Question:** Should you implement full virtualization for the application's servers or opt for a different approach?
*   **Justification Required:** Explain your choice based on the trade-offs of full virtualization, considering factors such as resource utilization, flexibility, workload compatibility, and potential performance impact.

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
### The Story
#### Problem: "The Virtualization Challenge"

In the bustling IT department of a large enterprise, our hero, Alex, an experienced system administrator, faced a daunting challenge. They had to deploy multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server to optimize resource utilization and reduce costs. However, the VMs kept crashing due to compatibility issues with native device drivers and hardware resources.

Alex spent countless hours troubleshooting and debugging, but no solution seemed forthcoming. The team's workload was piling up, and deadlines were looming. Just when they thought things couldn't get worse, a critical application failure occurred during peak business hours, leaving the company's reputation hanging by a thread.

#### 'Aha!' Moment: "Discovering Para-Virtualisation"

One day, while attending a conference on virtualization technologies, Alex stumbled upon an innovative solution that would change everything. They learned about para-virtualisation (PV), a method of virtualization that requires modifying the guest operating system to use hooks for improved machine execution simulation. PV is enabled by Type 1 Hypervisors.

Intrigued, Alex delved deeper into the concept and discovered its key points: it necessitates modifications to the guest OS but offers better compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources. The more they learned, the more convinced they became that PV was the answer to their prayers.

#### Impact: "A Game-Changer in Virtualization"

With PV, Alex's team could finally resolve the long-standing issue of VM crashes caused by incompatible drivers and hardware. By modifying the guest OS to use hooks, they ensured seamless integration with native device drivers and resources. The result? A drastic reduction in downtime, improved application performance, and increased user satisfaction.

But there was a trade-off: PV required modifications to the guest operating system, which meant extra upfront work for Alex's team. However, considering the long-term benefits, it was a decision they were willing to make. As the company continued to grow, the success of para-virtualisation ensured that their virtualization strategy remained efficient and scalable.

### Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Can a clever hack in how computers interact with hardware actually improve performance?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer facing a seemingly insurmountable challenge, who then discovers a game-changing solution.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing

- Pause after describing the problem to ask students: "Have you ever encountered compatibility issues between software and hardware?"
- Ask students to share their own experiences with virtualization challenges.
- After introducing para-virtualisation, pause for a moment to allow students to process the concept. This is also an excellent opportunity to ask questions about how PV works.

#### Analogy

Para-virtualisation can be likened to a "translator" between the guest operating system and the physical hardware. Just as a translator helps ensure smooth communication between people who speak different languages, PV acts as a bridge, facilitating the interaction between the guest OS and native device drivers and resources. This analogy simplifies the concept, making it easier for students to grasp.

This teaching story module is designed to engage your students with a relatable scenario, introduce them to the concept of para-virtualisation in a clear and concise manner, and encourage discussion about its significance and implications.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
Here are two distinct items as requested:

**Debate Topic:**

"Para-Virtualisation offers more advantages than disadvantages in terms of compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources."

This debate topic allows students to delve into the strengths and weaknesses of para-virtualization, encouraging critical thinking and argumentation. The debaters can discuss how the improved compatibility outweighs the need for modification of the guest operating system, or vice versa.

**What If Scenario Question:**

"A small-scale business is planning to migrate its existing server infrastructure to a cloud-based environment using virtualization technology. However, they are torn between para-virtualisation and full virtualisation due to concerns about hardware resource utilisation. Suppose you're an IT consultant tasked with recommending the best approach for this company. Would you choose para-virtualisation despite requiring modifications to the guest operating system, or would you opt for full virtualization despite potential limitations in native device driver support? Justify your choice by weighing the benefits of improved compatibility against the drawbacks of modifying the guest OS."

This scenario question pushes students to think critically about the trade-offs involved in choosing para-virtualisation and apply their knowledge of its strengths and weaknesses in a real-world context. By considering the specific needs and constraints of the business, they must weigh the advantages of improved compatibility against the potential costs of modifying the guest operating system.

### Interactive Activities for Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
Here are two items designed for an Educational Activity related to Hardware-Supported Virtualisation:

**1. Debate Topic:**

**"Resolved, that hardware-supported virtualization offers more benefits than drawbacks in modern computing environments."**

In this debate, students will argue in favor of (affirmative) or against (negative) the statement above. The affirmative team should focus on highlighting the strengths of hardware-supported virtualization, such as its potential for better performance characteristics and specific hypervisor types. On the other hand, the negative team should emphasize the weaknesses, like limited support and possible lack of widespread adoption.

**2. 'What If' Scenario Question:**

**"A company is considering adopting a new software application that requires high-performance virtual machines to run efficiently. However, they have already invested in hardware-based virtualization infrastructure. Should they opt for software-based virtualization or stick with their existing hardware-supported setup? Justify your decision based on the trade-offs between performance and support."**

In this scenario, students will be forced to weigh the benefits of using a software-based solution against the potential drawbacks of abandoning the existing hardware-supported infrastructure. They must consider factors like performance gains versus the cost of transitioning to a new technology stack or ensuring that the company's investment in hardware-supported virtualization is not wasted.

Both items are designed to encourage critical thinking, analysis, and discussion around the concept of hardware-supported virtualization, allowing students to explore its trade-offs and make informed decisions.
