## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
**Full Virtualisation: The Efficient Server**

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
In the bustling data centre of NovaTech, our team was struggling to manage a sea of servers. Each server was running its own operating system and application stack, resulting in wasted resources and reduced flexibility. We had multiple instances of Windows Server, Linux, and even some custom-built OSes. It was like trying to run different types of cars on the same road without any standardization.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, our lead engineer, Alex, stumbled upon a revolutionary concept called full virtualisation. This magic technique would allow us to create multiple virtual machines within a single physical server! Each VM could have its own operating system and application stack, just like the individual servers we used before. But here's the kicker: it wouldn't require separate hardware for each one.

Alex explained that with full virtualisation, our team could simulate all the hardware of the underlying device, creating an identical virtual environment for each machine. This meant no more wasted resources or compatibility issues between different systems. The possibilities seemed endless!

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Our decision to adopt full virtualisation transformed NovaTech's data centre into a lean, mean, and efficient machine. We consolidated our servers from 100 to just 20 physical units! Our resource utilisation soared, reducing energy consumption by over 30%. With this flexibility, we could now deploy diverse workloads, including those requiring specific OSes or software configurations.

However, Alex cautioned that full virtualisation wasn't a silver bullet. We needed to balance the benefits with potential performance trade-offs due to additional layers of abstraction. Nonetheless, our data centre became more agile and responsive than ever before.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: "Could we create an army of miniature servers within one machine?"
* **Point of View**: "Imagine yourself as a system administrator trying to manage multiple servers without a magic solution."

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**:
	+ Pause after the problem statement to ask: "How would you handle this challenge?"
	+ Ask students to share their initial thoughts on how to solve it.
	+ Reveal Alex's discovery of full virtualisation and explain its key aspects (hardware simulation, virtual machines).
* **Analogy**: Compare a physical server to a house with multiple rooms. Full virtualisation is like converting the entire house into separate apartments, each with its own unique setup but sharing common infrastructure.

Use these tips to engage your students in an interactive exploration of full virtualisation!

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
Here are two interactive elements:

**1. Debate Topic:**

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
**Para-Virtualisation: A Tale of Modified Machines**

### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
In a large enterprise, IT manager Emma had been struggling to get her company's servers running smoothly on new hardware. The problem was that many of the systems were designed to use proprietary device drivers that didn't work with the new equipment. She needed a way to make these old operating systems compatible with modern hardware, but changing them wasn't an option due to compatibility issues.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while researching solutions online, Emma stumbled upon para-virtualisation, a method of virtualization that required the guest operating system to be modified using hooks. She learned that this was made possible by Type 1 Hypervisors, which allowed for improved machine execution simulation. With this knowledge, she realized that modifying the guest OS wouldn't change its core functionality but would enable it to interact more effectively with hardware resources.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
With para-virtualisation implemented on her servers, Emma was able to use native device drivers and tap into the full potential of her new hardware. This meant better performance, reduced overhead from emulators or translators, and easier management of a heterogeneous environment. However, she also faced the challenge of initially modifying the guest operating system, which required additional work upfront but paid off in the long run with improved efficiency.

### Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter by allowing it to interact more effectively with modern hardware?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of Emma, an IT manager facing the challenge of integrating old operating systems with new hardware in a large enterprise environment.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing
- Pause briefly after describing the problem (IT manager struggling with compatibility issues) and ask students: "Have you ever had to deal with similar compatibility issues?"
- After explaining the concept of para-virtualisation, stop and ask: "How does modifying the guest OS but not its core functionality make sense in this context?"
- At the end, when discussing strengths and weaknesses, pause again to highlight the trade-offs involved and engage students in a discussion about their own experiences with compatibility issues.

#### Analogy
Imagine your favorite restaurant has moved to a new location but still wants to keep using all the old dishes they were famous for. Para-virtualisation is like taking the essence of those classic recipes (the operating system) and adjusting them slightly so they work perfectly in the new kitchen (new hardware). It's about making what's old work with what's new without changing its core identity.

This structured storytelling approach aims to engage students by framing the concept within a relatable scenario, highlighting key points through an interesting narrative, and encouraging reflection on trade-offs.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
Here are two distinct items:

**Debate Topic: "Resilience vs Flexibility"**

"Para-Virtualisation technologies offer better compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources, but at what cost? While they provide improved flexibility for operating systems to adapt to new hardware configurations, they also require significant modification of the guest operating system. In the end, does the added resilience that para-virtualisation provides outweigh the inflexibility it introduces?"

**What If Scenario Question: "The Upgrade Dilemma"**

"A company is planning to upgrade its virtualization environment from a Type 1 hypervisor to a para-virtualized solution. The new system promises improved hardware resource utilization and seamless integration with native device drivers. However, the IT team has concerns about the potential disruption to ongoing projects due to the need for guest operating system modifications.

If you were in charge of making this upgrade decision, would you choose the Type 1 hypervisor or the para-virtualized solution? Justify your choice considering both the benefits and drawbacks of each option."

These items are designed to encourage critical thinking and discussion among students about the trade-offs involved in choosing between a type 1 hypervisor and a para-virtualized system. By presenting a real-world scenario, they can apply their knowledge of para-virtualization strengths and weaknesses to make informed decisions.

## Teaching Module: Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
**Hardware-Supported Virtualisation: A Story of Efficiency**

### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
In a bustling IT department, the team faced a common challenge: managing multiple projects with varying operating system requirements on a single physical server. They tried various software-based virtualization solutions but encountered bottlenecks in performance and compatibility issues.

One day, while working late, engineer Alex stumbled upon an innovative approach that would revolutionize their workflow – hardware-supported virtualization. This concept fully simulated the features of a specific type of hypervisor, allowing multiple operating systems to run on one physical server with ease.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
Alex was amazed by how this method emulated the behavior and performance characteristics of the hardware. It wasn't just about running multiple OSes; it was an exact replica of what a dedicated server would do. With hardware-supported virtualization, their team could now run multiple projects on one physical server without worrying about compatibility or performance issues.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
As they implemented this new approach, the IT department noticed significant improvements in efficiency and productivity. Projects that once required separate servers for each OS were now consolidated onto a single machine. This not only reduced hardware costs but also simplified maintenance and updates.

However, Alex's team soon realized that hardware-supported virtualization had its limitations. It offered better performance characteristics for specific hypervisor types but had limited support and might not be as widely adopted as other types of virtualization. Despite these trade-offs, the benefits of efficiency and cost savings made it a valuable addition to their toolkit.

### Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of Alex, the engineer who stumbled upon hardware-supported virtualization while working late one night.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing
Pause after explaining how hardware-supported virtualization fully simulates a specific type of hypervisor. Ask students to consider what this means in practical terms for server management and resource allocation.

- "So, by emulating the behavior and performance characteristics of dedicated servers, we can run multiple OSes on one physical server... What implications do you think this has for IT departments like Alex's?"

#### Analogy
Explain hardware-supported virtualization using a car analogy:

"Imagine running different operating systems as different cars. Each car (OS) requires its own specific road conditions (hardware setup). With traditional software-based virtualization, it's like building a highway system that allows all these cars to drive on it. But with hardware-supported virtualization, the entire city is rebuilt to perfectly simulate the exact conditions for each type of car (hypervisor), allowing them to drive on the same 'road' without issues."

- "Now, can you think of situations where such an efficient road system would be beneficial?"

### Interactive Activities for Hardware-Supported Virtualisation
Here are two educational activity items:

**1. Debate Topic: "Embracing Hardware-Supported Virtualisation Overcomes Its Limitations"**

**Debate Statement:** "Hardware-supported virtualization, with its superior performance characteristics for specific hypervisor types, outweighs the limitations of limited support and adoption in modern IT infrastructure."

**Instructions:**
- Divide students into two teams based on this debate statement.
- Team 1 argues in favor of the statement (Embracing hardware-supported virtualisation overcomes its limitations).
- Team 2 argues against the statement (The limitations of hardware-supported virtualization outweigh its advantages).
- Assign each team roles, such as:
  - A lead debater
  - An IT expert who has implemented this technology before
  - A network administrator who can provide real-world examples
- Allocate time for each team to prepare, then have them present their arguments.
- Encourage the opposing team to ask questions and challenge the arguments presented.

**2. "What If" Scenario Question:**

**Scenario:** You are the IT manager of a growing company with high-performance computing needs. Your current infrastructure relies on virtual machines running on physical hardware. However, due to rapid growth, you're facing challenges in scaling your existing setup without significant performance degradation.

You've identified that your hypervisor is optimized for hardware-assisted virtualization (HAV) but are concerned about potential limitations in support and adoption of this technology in the market.

**Question:** Should you invest in upgrading your current infrastructure to support HAV, or should you opt for a more widely adopted but potentially less efficient solution?

**Instructions:**

- Provide students with the scenario above.
- Ask them to justify their choice based on the strengths (better performance characteristics) and weaknesses (limited support and adoption).
- Encourage them to consider factors such as:
  - Short-term vs. long-term benefits
  - Potential future-proofing of your infrastructure
  - Impact on budget and resource allocation
  - Trade-offs between current needs and potential future requirements

This "What If" scenario encourages critical thinking, analysis of trade-offs, and the application of the concept to real-world problems.
