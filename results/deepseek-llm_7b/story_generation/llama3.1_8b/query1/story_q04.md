## Teaching Module: Docker
**The Story**

### The Problem (Event)

In the world of High Performance Computing (HPC), researchers and scientists are constantly working on complex projects that require powerful computing resources. However, as these applications grew in complexity, so did their dependencies - each requiring a specific operating system, software libraries, and configurations to run smoothly. This led to a significant performance overhead due to hypervisor-based virtualization, where every application was running on its own separate virtual machine.

Imagine you're working on a crucial climate modeling project at a research facility, but your team's computer can't handle the demands of your simulations. You've tried tweaking settings and adjusting resources, but nothing seems to work efficiently. This is exactly the challenge many HPC users faced before Docker became a solution.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)

One day, while working on a similar project, you stumbled upon an open-source containerization platform called Docker. It promised to revolutionize how applications were packaged, deployed, and scaled by using lightweight containers that could share system resources with the host machine. You discovered that Docker uses just-in-time compilation for performance optimization and reduces dependency reduction by packaging an application with its runtime dependencies, libraries, system tools, and configuration files.

Docker's magic lies in its ability to automate software packaging, deployment, and scaling within these containers. It shares system resources between the host machine and containers, which not only improves efficiency but also avoids penalties incurred on hardware due to hypervisor-based virtualization. This discovery opened up new possibilities for your team - you could now run multiple applications concurrently without sacrificing performance.

### The Impact (Meaning)

The impact of Docker was profound. With Docker, deploying applications became a breeze, no longer requiring the heavy overhead of setting up separate virtual machines for each application. Your team's climate modeling project took off with increased speed and efficiency, allowing you to analyze more data in less time. You could easily scale your applications as needed without worrying about compatibility issues.

However, it's not all smooth sailing. As with any powerful tool, Docker requires careful management to prevent potential security risks. But the benefits far outweigh the challenges. The ease of application deployment, scalability, and resource isolation that Docker offers has made it a game-changer in HPC applications, allowing scientists and researchers like you to focus on what matters most - advancing knowledge.

**Storytelling Hooks**

- **Dramatic Question**: "Could packaging your computer like a shipping container actually make it run faster?"
  
- **Point of View**: "From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in High Performance Computing, discover how Docker revolutionized their work."

**Classroom Delivery Tips**

### Pacing

1. Pause after describing the problem to ask students if they've ever encountered similar challenges with software deployment and virtualization.
2. After introducing Docker, pause again to ask how the concept of packaging applications within containers seems like a solution to these problems.

### Analogy

Docker works similarly to shipping containers - just as shipping containers are designed to be easily loaded onto ships or trains without needing to adapt to their destination, Docker's containers package an application with its dependencies and configurations, making them easily deployable across different computing environments. This analogy can help students grasp the concept of containerization better.

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
**Linux Containers (LXC) Story Module**

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
In the bustling IT department of a large company, engineers were struggling to manage and deploy applications efficiently. With multiple developers working on different projects, resources were being wasted due to inconsistent environments and duplicated efforts. This inefficiency was affecting project timelines and budget.

One day, while trying to troubleshoot an issue with resource allocation for a new application, Engineer Maria stumbled upon the concept of Linux Containers (LXC). She discovered that LXC was a built-in feature in the Linux operating system that provided a lightweight way to create isolated environments for running applications.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
Maria learned that LXC used namespaces and cgroups to share resources with the host while maintaining process isolation. This meant developers could run multiple applications on the same server without worrying about interference or resource competition. She was amazed by how this feature could revolutionize their work, making it easier to set up, test, and deploy applications.

With LXC, Maria envisioned a future where their team could efficiently manage resources, reducing waste and increasing productivity. She saw that LXC's use of namespaces allowed for isolated environments, keeping each application's files, networks, and processes separate from others, ensuring maximum flexibility and efficiency.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The introduction of Linux Containers (LXC) transformed the IT department's workflow. Engineers could now focus on writing code rather than managing complex environments. Resources were utilized more effectively, reducing costs and improving project timelines. Maria was proud to be part of a team that had successfully implemented LXC, enabling them to deliver projects faster and with higher quality.

However, Maria also noted that while LXC offered ease of use for existing Linux users and efficient resource utilization, it did come with limitations. Its portability outside the Linux environment was restricted, which required careful planning when working with applications meant to be deployed on other platforms.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
"Can a feature that makes a computer dumber actually make it smarter for developers?"

#### Point of View
"From the perspective of Engineer Maria, who had to troubleshoot inefficient resource allocation and discover the power of Linux Containers (LXC)."

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing
- **Pause after "Engineer Maria stumbled upon the concept...**: Ask students if they've ever encountered a situation where resources were wasted due to inconsistent environments.
- **After explaining namespaces and cgroups:** Pause for students to grasp how these concepts contribute to efficient resource sharing and process isolation.

#### Analogy
"Imagine you're in a large, open office with many colleagues working on various projects. Without LXC, it's like everyone is trying to work from the same desk without any dividers - chaos ensues! But with LXC, each project gets its own 'cubicle' (namespace) where it can focus and operate independently, while still sharing common resources efficiently."

This analogy helps students visualize how namespaces and cgroups allow for resource sharing and isolation in a more relatable scenario.

### Interactive Activities for Linux Containers (LXC)

**Item 2: 'What If' Scenario Question**

**Title:** "Containerization for Legacy Applications"

**Scenario:**

A company has a legacy application built on Windows, but it's struggling with performance issues due to high resource utilization. The IT team is considering containerizing the application using LXC on a Linux-based infrastructure. However, this would require rewriting certain components of the application to work within the Linux environment.

**Question:**

"Should the company choose to containerize its legacy Windows application using LXC on a Linux environment, despite the potential need for modifications and the limitations in portability outside of Linux?"

**Expected Justifications:**

*   Resource efficiency: How would containerization impact the resource utilization of the application, considering the constraints imposed by the Linux environment?
*   Cost savings: Would the cost of rewriting components of the legacy application outweigh the benefits of improved performance and reduced resource utilization through containerization?
*   Portability limitations: Are there any potential long-term implications for maintaining a Windows-based application in a Linux-centric infrastructure?
