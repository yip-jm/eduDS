Google donated the Kubernetes project to the newly formed Cloud-Native Computing Foundation in 2015. Kubernetes orchestration allows you to build application services that span multiple containers, schedule containers across a cluster, scale those containers, and manage their health over time. Kubernetes eliminates many of the manual processes involved in deploying and scaling"
