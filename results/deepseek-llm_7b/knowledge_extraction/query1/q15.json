  "Core_Concepts": [
    {
      "Concept": "Memory Virtualization",
      "Definition": "The process of creating multiple virtual memory spaces on a single physical hardware platform to run multiple operating systems simultaneously. This is achieved by emulating the behavior of real hardware in software.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Virtual Memory Spaces are created using page tables that map logical addresses (virtual) to physical addresses (real)",
        "Memory Virtualization allows for efficient use of system resources, as multiple operating systems can share a single pool of memory",
        "Shadow Page Tables help in accelerating the mappings between virtual and real memory."
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Memory virtualization is crucial to modern computing. It enables multi-tenancy environments like cloud computing where one physical machine serves many clients, each with their own operating system.",
      "Strengths": "Improves resource utilization, allows for efficient use of memory and CPU resources, supports multiple OSs on a single platform",
      "Weaknesses": "Can be complex to implement, may introduce performance overhead due to virtualization layers."

    {
      "Concept": "I/O Virtualization",
      "Definition": "The process of creating virtual devices that emulate real hardware and translate VM requests into system hardware operations. This allows multiple VMs to share a single set of physical I/O resources.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Virtual Devices are created by the hypervisor to present each VM with standardized hardware",
        "I/O Virtualization manages routing of I/O requests between virtual devices and shared physical hardware",
        "The VMM translates guest OS's I/O requests into system hardware operations."

      "Significance_Detail": "I/O virtualization is essential for efficient resource utilization in cloud computing environments. It allows multiple VMs to share a single set of I/O resources, reducing costs and complexity.",
      "Strengths": "Improves resource utilization, reduces costs by sharing physical I/O devices among VMs",
      "Weaknesses": "Can introduce performance overhead due to translation between virtual and real hardware."

      "Concept": "MMU Virtualization",
      "Definition": "The process of emulating the behavior of a Memory Management Unit (MMU) in software, allowing multiple VMs to share a single physical machine. This is achieved by using shadow page tables for faster mappings.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Guest OS's memory mapping remains unchanged but VMM updates shadow page tables",
        "One has to virtualize the MMU to support guest OSes running on a single system",
        "The VMM uses shadow page tables to map guest physical memory to machine memory."
