    {
      "Concept": "Monolithic architecture",
      "Definition": "An architectural style where all functionality of a system is implemented in one large, cohesive unit. This contrasts with service-oriented architecture.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "A single program that performs multiple functions",
        "All components are tightly coupled and interconnected",
        "Difficult to scale or maintain over time"

    {
      "Concept": "Stateless design",
      "Definition": "In software architecture, a stateless system does not retain any information about previous interactions. Each interaction is treated as an independent event and no state changes between requests.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "No data persistence across client-server interactions",
        "Improves scalability by reducing the need for complex state management",

      "Concept": "Interface abstraction",
      "Definition": "The process of defining a contract between a service and its clients, specifying what services it provides and how they can be accessed. This allows for decoupling of the client from the implementation details of the service.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Defines the rules by which a service communicates with other services or clients",
        "Promotes flexibility in terms of technology selection",
        "Enables easier maintenance and updates"

      "Concept": "Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)",
      "Definition": "An architectural style that breaks down a large, complex system into smaller, independent services. These services communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Focuses on providing reusable business capabilities",
        "Promotes flexibility and scalability by breaking down the system into smaller components",

      "Concept": "Service broker",
      "Definition": "A component that enables service discovery in a service-oriented architecture. It helps clients locate and access appropriate services by maintaining a registry of available services, their interfaces, and other relevant information.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Improves discoverability and accessibility of services",
