  "Core_Concepts": [
    {
      "Concept": "Microservices",
      "Definition": "A software development approach that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability and communicates with other services through APIs.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Promotes loose coupling between services",
        "Enables faster deployment and scaling of individual components",
        "Supports modular development and evolution of the system"
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Microservices enable a more agile, scalable, and resilient architecture for complex applications.",
      "Strengths": "Promotes flexibility in evolving business requirements, enables parallel development, and facilitates continuous delivery.",
      "Weaknesses": null
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Container Technologies",
      "Definition": "A technology that packages an application with its runtime dependencies into a container. This allows the application to run consistently across different environments.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Docker is a popular containerization platform",
        "Containers provide a consistent environment for deployment and testing",
        "Helps in achieving portability, scalability, and isolation of applications"
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Container technologies enable faster application delivery, improved resource utilization, and simplified management.",
      "Strengths": "Promotes rapid deployment, reduces dependency on specific hardware or operating systems, and simplifies the development process.",
      "Weaknesses": null
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Orchestration Tools",
      "Definition": "Software tools that manage containers and their interactions. Examples include Kubernetes and Docker Swarm.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Manage container deployment, scaling, and networking",
        "Enable complex service compositions with ease",
        "Promote consistency in application behavior across different environments"
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Orchestration tools simplify the management of microservices-based applications by automating tasks such as scaling and rolling updates.",
      "Strengths": "Enables efficient handling of large-scale, distributed systems, and promotes consistent application behavior.",
      "Weaknesses": null
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Cloud-Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)",
      "Definition": "A nonprofit organization that aims to foster the growth of cloud-native technologies by promoting open source projects such as Kubernetes.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Focuses on containerization, microservices, and other emerging trends in cloud computing",
        "Provides a reference architecture for building cloud-native solutions",
        "Supports collaboration among technology companies"
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "CNCF plays a crucial role in standardizing and promoting the adoption of cloud-native technologies.",
      "Strengths": "Facilitates knowledge sharing, fosters innovation, and accelerates the growth of cloud-native ecosystems.",
      "Weaknesses": null
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Cloud-Native Reference Architecture",
      "Definition": "A four-layer architecture that covers infrastructure, provisioning, runtime, and orchestration. It defines a stack of technologies used for building cloud-native solutions.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Incorporates containerization, microservices, and orchestration tools",
        "Enables efficient scaling, deployment, and management of applications",
        "Promotes consistency across different environments"
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "The Cloud-Native Reference Architecture provides a comprehensive framework for building cloud-native solutions.",
      "Strengths": "Simplifies the development process, promotes consistent application behavior, and enables efficient resource utilization.",
