  "Core_Concepts": [
    {
      "Concept": "Full Virtualisation",
      "Definition": "A method of virtualisation that fully simulates all the hardware of the underlying device by providing a virtual machine. This means that it emulates the behaviour and performance characteristics of the physical hardware, allowing multiple operating systems to run on one physical server.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Fully simulates all the hardware",
        "Provides a virtual machine",
        "Enables multiple operating systems to run on one physical server"
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Full virtualization is an essential technique in modern data centres and cloud computing, allowing for efficient use of resources by running multiple virtual machines on a single physical server. It also enables the deployment of diverse workloads that may not be compatible with each other.",
      "Strengths": "Increases resource utilization, flexibility, and workload compatibility",
      "Weaknesses": "May have performance trade-offs due to additional layers of abstraction"
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Para-Virtualisation",
      "Definition": "A method of virtualisation that requires the guest operating system to be modified to use a set of hooks to improve machine execution simulation. Para-virtualisation is enabled by Type1 Hypervisors.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Requires modification of the guest operating system",
        "Uses hooks for improved machine execution simulation"
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Para-virtualisation allows for better compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources, but requires modifications to the guest operating system. It is commonly used in enterprise environments.",
      "Strengths": "Better compatibility with native device drivers and hardware resources",
      "Weaknesses": "Requires modification of the guest operating system"
    },
    {
      "Concept": "Hardware-Supported Virtualisation",
      "Definition": "A method of virtualisation that fully simulates all the features of a specific type of hypervisor. This means it emulates the behaviour and performance characteristics of the hardware, allowing multiple operating systems to run on one physical server.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Fully simulates a specific type of hypervisor",
        "Enables multiple operating systems to run on one physical server"
      ],
      "Significance_Detail": "Hardware-supported virtualisation is used in some enterprise environments, but it has limited support and may not be as widely adopted as other types of virtualization.",
      "Strengths": "May offer better performance characteristics for specific hypervisor types",
      "Weaknesses": "Has limited support and may not be as widely adopted"

  "Overall_Summary": "Virtualization techniques include full, para-, and hardware-supported virtualization. Full virtualization fully simulates all the hardware of the underlying device by providing a virtual machine, while para-virtualisation requires modification of the guest operating system to use hooks for improved simulation. Hardware-supported virtualisation fully simulates a specific type of hypervisor.",
