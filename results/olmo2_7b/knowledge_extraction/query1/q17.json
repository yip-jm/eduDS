      "Concept": "Microservices",
      "Definition": "An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Each microservice is independently deployable, scalable, and can be developed by small teams.",
        "They communicate through APIs, enabling faster deployment cycles and easier maintenance.",
        "Microservices reduce the complexity of large monolithic applications."

  "Overall_Summary": "Cloud-native architecture is characterized by the use of microservices, containers, and orchestration layers, as defined by the CNCF. This architecture supports continuous deployment, elastic scaling, and faster feature introduction, exemplified by real-world applications from companies like Netflix and Uber.",
