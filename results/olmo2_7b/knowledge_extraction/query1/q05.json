  "Overall_Summary": "Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) evolved from monolithic systems and represents a shift towards distributed, scalable applications. SOA emphasizes statelessness to ensure scalability and uses brokers for service discovery, with abstraction through interfaces hiding the implementation details from clients.",
