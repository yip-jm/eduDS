  "Overall_Summary": "Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration tool that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It consists of Pods, Clusters, Master components (like etcd, API server, and controller manager), and kubelets which together enable the seamless scaling of microservice-based architectures across multiple nodes.",

Google donated the Kubernetes project to the newly formed Cloud-Native Computing Foundation in 2015. Kubernetes orchestration allows you to build application services that span multiple containers, schedule containers across a cluster, scale those containers, and manage their health over time. Kubernetes eliminates many of the manual processes involved in deploying and scaling"
