## Lesson Plan Outline: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

**Lesson Title:** From Monolithic to Microservices: Understanding Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

**Introduction (Hook)**: 
* Imagine building an application as a collection of independent services, seamlessly interacting with each other. That's the power of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)!

**Core Content Delivery:**

1. **Evolution of SOA:**
    * Understanding the limitations of monolithic systems.
    * Tracing the transition from monolithic to SOA.


2. **Statelessness: Key to Scalability:**
    * Learning why statelessness is crucial for scalability and performance.
    * Exploring the advantages of statelessness in distributed systems.


3. **Abstraction through Interfaces:**
    * Discovering the role of interfaces in hiding implementation details.
    * Understanding the importance of clear and concise interfaces for reusability.


4. **Brokers for Service Discovery:**
    * Exploring the function of brokers in facilitating service discovery.
    * Learning how brokers enable seamless interaction between services.


**Key Activity/Discussion:**
* Divide the class into small groups.
* Provide each group with a real-world example of a service-oriented architecture.
* Have groups discuss the advantages of using SOA for that particular application.


**Conclusion & Synthesis:**
* Summarize the key elements of SOA: statelessness, abstraction, and service discovery.
* Highlight how SOA represents a shift from monolithic systems towards distributed, scalable applications.
* Conclude by connecting the concepts learned back to the original question and real-world applications of SOA.
