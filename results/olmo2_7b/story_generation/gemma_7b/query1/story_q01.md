## **Lesson Plan Outline: Virtualization Techniques**

**1. Introduction (Hook)**
- Engage students with the challenges of legacy systems and the need for efficient resource utilization.

**2. Core Content Delivery**
- **Full Virtualization:** Simulates entire hardware environment, offering isolation and security.
- **Para-Virtualization:** Modifies OS for efficiency with hardware support, suitable for memory-intensive applications.
- **Hardware-Supported Virtualization:** Utilizes CPU features to improve performance and resource utilization.

**3. Key Activity/Discussion**
- Divide students into small groups.
- Provide scenarios where each virtualization technique would be most appropriate.
- Have groups discuss and present their recommendations.

**4. Conclusion & Synthesis**
- Review the different virtualization techniques and their key features.
- Highlight the importance of hypervisors (Type 1 and Type 2) in facilitating virtualization.
- Summarize the performance implications of each approach.

**5. Extension Activities**
- Case studies of successful virtualization implementations.
- Exploring the future of virtualization and emerging technologies.
