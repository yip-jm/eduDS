## Lesson Plan Outline:

**Lesson Title:** Service-Oriented Architecture: Building Scalable and Maintainable Applications

**Introduction (Hook):** 
- Real-world example: Challenges of monolithic architectures in scalability and maintenance.
- Introduce Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) as a solution.

**Core Content Delivery:**

1. **Origins of SOA:**
    - Evolution from monolithic architectures.
    - Benefits of stateless design for scalability and maintainability.


2. **Interface Abstraction:**
    - Hiding implementation details behind well-defined interfaces.
    - Role of contracts and stubs in communication.


3. **Service Brokers:**
    - Role in service discovery and routing.
    - Mechanisms for publishing and subscribing to services.

**Key Activity/Discussion:**
- Case study: Analyze a real-world application that utilizes SOA principles.
- Brainstorm: Discuss challenges and benefits of implementing SOA.

**Conclusion & Synthesis:**
- Recap of the core concepts covered.
- Connection back to the Overall Summary: SOA empowers scalable and maintainable applications by leveraging stateless design, interface abstraction, and service brokers.
- Future directions and applications of SOA.
