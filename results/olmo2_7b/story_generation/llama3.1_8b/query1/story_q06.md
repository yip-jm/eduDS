Here is the Lesson Plan Outline:

**Lesson Title**
### From Monoliths to Microservices: Understanding Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

**Introduction (Hook)**
Objective: To pique students' interest by illustrating the limitations of monolithic architectures and the need for a more scalable approach.

* Discuss the challenges faced in maintaining large, single-unit systems (monoliths)
* Introduce the concept of SOA as a solution to these challenges
* Pose the original question or present a real-world scenario where SOA has been successfully implemented

**Core Content Delivery**
Objective: To clearly explain the core concepts of SOA and their significance in modern software development.

1.  **Evolution from Monolithic Architectures**: Explain how SOA emerged as a response to the limitations of monolithic systems
2.  **Stateless Design Principles**: Describe the benefits and implementation of stateless design in SOA
3.  **Interface Abstraction**: Illustrate how interface abstraction enables loose coupling between services and promotes modularity
4.  **Service Brokers for Service Discovery**: Explain the role of service brokers in facilitating standardized communication and service discovery

**Key Activity/Discussion**
Objective: To engage students in a hands-on activity or discussion that reinforces their understanding of SOA concepts.

* Group activity: Divide students into teams to design a simple SOA-based system using a provided case study
* Class discussion: Have students share their designs and discuss the challenges they faced, highlighting key takeaways from their experience

**Conclusion & Synthesis**
Objective: To tie together the core concepts covered in the lesson, emphasizing how they collectively contribute to the overall benefits of SOA.

* Recap the main points covered in the lesson
* Highlight real-world examples or success stories that illustrate the effectiveness of SOA in addressing scalability and maintainability issues
* Emphasize the importance of understanding SOA principles for effective software development
