Here is the Lesson Plan Outline in Markdown format:

### Lesson Title
### Cloud Computing Unveiled: Grid vs. Cloud Fundamentals

### Introduction (Hook)
**Objective:** Capture students' attention by highlighting the limitations of traditional computing methods and the benefits of cloud computing.

*   Briefly introduce the concept of distributed computing and its challenges.
*   Present a real-world scenario where Grid computing is used, but its limitations are evident (e.g., high costs, complexity).
*   Introduce the promise of cloud computing as a solution to these problems.

### Core Content Delivery
**Objective:** Clearly explain the core concepts related to Cloud Computing and Grid Computing, highlighting their differences in resource control methods.

1.  **Grid Computing Overview**: Define Grid computing and its history.
    *   Explain how Grids use X.509 access for authentication and authorization.
2.  **Cloud Computing Fundamentals**: Introduce cloud computing as a paradigm shift from traditional IT.
    *   Discuss the concept of pay-per-use elasticity and on-demand resource allocation.
3.  **Resource Control Methods**: Compare and contrast resource control methods in Grids (X.509) with those in clouds (pay-per-use).
4.  **Cloud's Flexible Billing**: Explain how cloud providers offer flexible billing options, unlike traditional Grid computing models.

### Key Activity/Discussion
**Objective:** Engage students in an interactive activity to reinforce their understanding of the core concepts and facilitate peer-to-peer learning.

*   Divide students into small groups and assign each group a scenario where they need to decide between using Grid or cloud computing for a project.
*   Ask them to discuss and present their decision, highlighting their reasoning based on resource control methods and billing models.

### Conclusion & Synthesis
**Objective:** Summarize the key takeaways from the lesson and connect back to the Overall Summary.

*   Review the main points covered in the lesson: Grid computing limitations, cloud computing benefits, and pay-per-use elasticity.
*   Emphasize how understanding these concepts is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of distributed computing and IT infrastructure.
