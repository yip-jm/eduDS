# Lesson Title: Introduction to Kubernetes - Container Orchestration in Action

## Introduction (Hook)
Objective: To engage students by introducing a real-world problem that can be solved using Kubernetes and piquing their curiosity about container orchestration.

As students enter the classroom, display a large image of a busy software development team working on various components for an online store's website. Explain to them how these developers need to deploy multiple microservices across different servers in order to handle customer requests efficiently. Mention that this is where Kubernetes comes into play as it helps manage containerized applications and ensures smooth scaling of the system.

## Core Content Delivery
Objective: To provide an overview of the key concepts related to Kubernetes, with a focus on Pods, Clusters, Master components (etcd, API server, controller manager), and kubelets.

1. **Pods**: Explain that in Kubernetes, a pod is a group of one or more containers sharing the same network stack and storage resources. It provides isolation for running applications within each container.
2. **Clusters**: A cluster refers to a set of interconnected nodes that work together as a single unit. These nodes are responsible for hosting pods and managing workloads across them.
3. **Master Components**: Discuss how Kubernetes has three main components responsible for controlling the state of the entire system: etcd, API server, and controller manager.
    - Etcd is used to store and sync data related to the cluster's configuration between all nodes in real-time.
    - The API server serves as a gateway for clients to access information about the current state of their applications running within the Kubernetes environment.
    - Controller Manager, an essential component responsible for maintaining desired states of application resources such as Pods and Services.
4. **Kubelets**: Explain how kubelets are agents on each node that manage communication between local nodes and the master components located elsewhere in a cluster. They ensure containers run smoothly within their assigned pods without interruption.

## Key Activity/Discussion
Objective: To facilitate deeper understanding of core Kubernetes concepts through hands-on activities, debates, or discussions among students.

Divide your class into small groups, assign each group one of the main components (etcd, API server, controller manager, and kubelet). Have them research their assigned component's role in Kubernetes and present it back to the rest of the class. Encourage other students to ask questions about the specific responsibilities of these components and how they work together within a cluster.

## Conclusion & Synthesis
Objective: To wrap up the lesson by connecting the core concepts covered back to the original question, emphasizing the importance of container orchestration in managing microservice-based architectures.

As students are wrapping up their discussion on Kubernetes master components, ask them how these features would help a software development team manage and scale various microservices efficiently as illustrated in the introduction scenario for an online store's website. Summarize that by understanding core concepts such as Pods, Clusters, Master components (etcd, API server, controller manager), and kubelets within Kubernetes, students are equipped to handle complex container orchestration tasks effectively in real-world scenarios.
