# Lesson Title: Cloud-Native Computing: Microservices, Orchestration & Containerization

## Introduction (Hook)
Objective: To engage students by asking them about their experience with using websites or apps that are fast and reliable in a high-traffic environment. Introduce cloud-native computing as the solution to these issues. 

---

## Core Content Delivery
1. Definition of Cloud-Native Computing: Explain what it means and its benefits compared to traditional architectures.
2. Microservices: Discuss the advantages of microservices architecture, including scalability, resilience, and independence from each other. Provide examples like Netflix's microservice architecture.
3. Containerization with Docker & Kubernetes: Introduce students to container technologies (Docker) and orchestration tools (Kubernetes), demonstrating how they help in deploying and managing applications at scale. Present the Uber's use of Kubernetes for its ride-sharing service as an example. 
4. Orchestration Tools like Kubernetes: Discuss the role of orchestrators, their functions, and benefits to application deployment and management in a cloud environment. Share examples from companies like Uber and Google.
5. CNCF's Stack Definition & Examples: Explain what the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is and how it supports cloud-native technologies. Provide real-world case studies of companies that follow this stack for their applications, such as HashiCorp, GitLab, or VMware.

## Key Activity/Discussion
Objective: To enable students to apply the learned concepts by participating in a group discussion on how these cloud-native technologies can be used to improve application performance and scalability. 

### Steps for this activity:
1. Divide the class into small groups of three or four students each, with one student acting as a team leader.
2. Provide a scenario where a fast and reliable website is required (e.g., an e-commerce platform during Black Friday sales). Encourage the teams to brainstorm how cloud-native computing could help solve this problem using the discussed technologies (microservices, containerization/orchestration tools, etc.).
3. Each team presents their findings and ideas in front of the class, while other students listen actively and take notes for further synthesis at the end of the lesson. 
4. After all teams have presented, facilitate a group discussion to explore similarities and differences among the various solutions proposed by the different groups.
5. Summarize key insights from this activity, highlighting how cloud-native computing can improve application performance in high-traffic scenarios, citing examples like Netflix or Uber's use of containerization and orchestration tools.

## Conclusion & Synthesis
Objective: To summarize and connect the lesson back to the overall summary by asking students to reflect on what they have learned about cloud-native computing, its components (microservices, Kubernetes), and how these technologies can benefit their future projects or careers in software development.
