## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

Once upon a time in the world of cloud computing, there was a big concern about who would be responsible for securing data and systems when they were stored on remote servers. Users wanted to know that their providers could protect them from malicious attacks, while service providers needed assurance that users wouldn't accidentally expose themselves or others to security threats. This confusion led to many misunderstandings, leaving everyone unsure of what tasks should fall into whose hands - until the Shared Responsibility Model was discovered!

The Shared Responsibility Model is a framework for dividing and clearly defining responsibilities in cloud computing. It states that each party involved in providing services (cloud service providers) or using them (users) must take responsibility for securing their own areas: 
- Cloud Service Providers are responsible for protecting the infrastructure they provide, such as hardware, operating systems, network components, etc.
- Users should ensure security of their data and applications while being hosted on these shared infrastructures.

This discovery was a game changer! It clarified expectations between both parties, preventing misunderstandings about who is responsible for what aspects of security control. This allowed users to tailor their own security measures according to their needs and gave service providers peace-of-mind knowing that they were not being asked to shoulder responsibilities beyond their scope of expertise.

The impact of this model was far reaching: it brought clarity, reduced misunderstandings, improved communication between both parties, increased trust in the cloud services sector, allowed for more efficient use of resources and enabled users to focus on what matters most - protecting themselves! 

2. Storytelling Hooks

*Dramatic Question*: Who will take care of securing data stored on remote servers?

*Point of View:* From the perspective of a user seeking clarity about their security responsibilities in cloud computing.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips

*Pacing*: Pause after introducing the Shared Responsibility Model to let students think about its impact and implications for both users and service providers.

*Analogy*: Imagine you're buying a house built on a cliff - it would be foolish not to invest in reinforcing the structure against potential landslides, just as it is unwise to neglect securing your data when using cloud services!

### Interactive Activities for Shared Responsibility Model
1. Debate Topic: "Is the Shared Responsibility Model effective in reducing climate change?"
The strengths of the shared responsibility model include promoting collaboration among different stakeholders in addressing environmental issues (e.g., government, industry, NGOs), encouraging innovation through diverse perspectives and resources, and fostering a sense of ownership over solutions. The weaknesses of this model could be that it might not prioritize certain groups or interests, leading to unequal distribution of responsibilities and resources, potentially resulting in slower progress on climate change mitigation efforts.

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine your school has adopted the shared responsibility model for reducing plastic waste in its cafeteria. A local fast-food chain wants to donate a new burger wrapper made from 10% biodegradable materials instead of paper, and they want to use it at lunchtime events on campus. The headmaster is considering this donation but wonders if accepting this new product could undermine the school's goal of reducing plastic waste. How would you design an action plan that accounts for both environmental concerns and community expectations while using the shared responsibility model?"

## Teaching Module: Identity and Access Management (IAM)
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

----

The Problem (Event): Imagine you're a software engineer tasked with developing an online store that needs to securely manage customer data and transactions. You notice there are no clear policies in place regarding who has access to what information, and your team is struggling to keep track of permissions for each user. 

----

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): One day during a team meeting, you're introduced to Identity and Access Management (IAM). This concept involves establishing a clear set of policies that determines which users have access to specific data or systems within your online store. It also includes procedures for managing digital identities efficiently by tracking changes in user permissions and maintaining audit trails for accountability purposes.

----

The Impact (Meaning): Implementing IAM is critical because it helps protect sensitive customer information, maintain compliance with data protection laws, and foster trust among users. By implementing IAM, you can ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the online store's resources, preventing unauthorized individuals from accessing or manipulating user data. However, introducing IAM may require additional investments in technology and human resources for policy management, making it a trade-off worth considering.

----

2. Storytelling Hooks:
   - Dramatic Question: "How can we ensure that only the right people have access to sensitive customer information while keeping costs manageable?"
   - Point of View: From the perspective of an IT manager trying to balance security and usability in a cloud-based application.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

When teaching this concept, start by introducing IAM as a solution to a real-world problem faced by your students (the online store example). Pause to allow them to consider how the lack of clear policies might affect the overall functionality and security of the platform. To help further understanding, use an analogy like "imagine each user has a unique key that unlocks access to their specific data in a locked cabinet; IAM ensures only authorized keys can open the correct cabinets." Finally, discuss the trade-offs by asking students if they think investing in IAM is worth it given its advantages and potential costs.

### Interactive Activities for Identity and Access Management (IAM)
1. Debate Topic: Should Organizations Rely Solely On IAM Systems For Access Control?

Strengths:
- IAM systems offer centralized control over user access management, reducing potential breaches by limiting unauthorized access.
- IAM allows organizations to track and monitor user activity for better compliance with regulatory requirements such as HIPAA or PCI DSS.

Weaknesses:
- Overreliance on IAM may lead to increased vulnerability if the system is compromised due to insufficient security measures in place.
- IAM systems can be resource-intensive, requiring significant investment in hardware, software licenses, and personnel training for implementation and maintenance.

2. What If Scenario Question: Imagine a company has just adopted an Identity Access Management (IAM) system for managing access to their proprietary software. The IT department is currently evaluating the effectiveness of this new IAM solution by analyzing user activity logs from the past six months. Suddenly, they notice that some employees have been repeatedly accessing sensitive data without any authorization.

What should be done next? Should management implement additional security measures (e.g., multi-factor authentication) to prevent unauthorized access or focus on improving employee training and awareness of IAM policies?
