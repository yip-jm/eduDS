# Lesson Title: Understanding Virtualization Techniques - Full, Para-Virtual, and Hardware-Supported Methods

## Introduction (Hook)
Objective: To engage students with a real-world example of virtualization and its importance in computer systems.

"Imagine you're on an island with limited resources but want to build your own thriving community. How would you manage the scarcity of essential items like water, food, shelter, etc.? This scenario can be compared to how we handle resource allocation within a computer system. Full virtualization fully simulates hardware by allocating specific devices and using them as if they were actual physical systems."

## Core Content Delivery 
Objective: To provide clear explanations on the core concepts of full, para-virtual, and hardware-supported virtualization methods with hypervisors (Type 1 and Type 2), their performance implications.

1. Full Virtualization - What it is, how it works, examples in real life applications (e.g., server farms)
2. Para-Virtualization - How the modified OS aids efficiency while using hardware support, its advantages & disadvantages
3. Hardware-Supported Virtualization - Leveraging CPU features to improve performance, comparisons with full and para-virtual methods
4. Hypervisors - Type 1 vs. Type 2 hypervisors, their roles, benefits, and drawbacks in the context of virtualization techniques
5. Performance Implications - Analyzing factors impacting each method's performance and comparing them (full, para-, hardware-supported) to conclude which method is best suited for various use cases.

## Key Activity/Discussion 
Objective: To facilitate an interactive learning experience where students apply their knowledge of virtualization techniques through a group activity or discussion.

Group Discussion: Divide the class into small groups and ask them to identify different scenarios in which they might choose one type of virtualization over another, considering factors like resource allocation efficiency, performance requirements, scalability, etc. Facilitate discussions on how each method could be beneficial for these situations.

## Conclusion & Synthesis 
Objective: To summarize the key takeaways from the lesson and connect them back to the original question or real-world problem introduced in the introduction.

"In conclusion, we learned about three types of virtualization techniques - full, para-, and hardware-supported methods along with their respective hypervisors (Type 1 & Type 2). We also considered performance implications for different scenarios where you would choose one method over another based on resource allocation efficiency or other relevant factors. Now that we have a deeper understanding of these concepts, let's apply them to the original question and analyze how each technique could help address water scarcity within our island community."
