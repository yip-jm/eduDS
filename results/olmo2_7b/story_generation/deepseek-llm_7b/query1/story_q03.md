## Teaching Module: Docker
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

---

The Problem (Event): Imagine you are a developer working on an application that needs to run smoothly across various platforms and systems. You've spent countless hours testing your app in different environments, but each time there is a new system or platform, the configuration of dependencies becomes a nightmare. The consistency between development and production environments remains elusive.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Enter Docker. It turns out that it wasn’t about the application itself – it was more about how to package, deploy, and manage it. With Docker, you can create lightweight containers for your applications, which consist of everything required to run an app: code, libraries, system tools, settings, and dependencies. These containers are consistent across different environments and platforms because they’re built from a single image.

The Impact (Meaning): The discovery of Docker drastically simplified the deployment process by providing a standardized way to package and distribute applications. This standardization reduced the complexity of setting up development and production environments. As a result, developers could quickly develop their application while ensuring its consistency across different systems. Faster time-to-market was achieved along with improved consistency in various platforms which led to more efficient software delivery.

2. Storytelling Hooks

---

Dramatic Question: "Can we really make our applications smarter by making them run on any platform?"
Point of View: From the perspective of a DevOps engineer, Docker has been a game-changer in containerizing and deploying their applications with ease across different environments.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips

---

Pacing: When discussing Docker's features, take your time to emphasize its importance in simplifying deployment processes. After explaining how containers are created using images for consistency, share the analogy of a pizza delivery service. Just as you can guarantee that each slice of pizza is consistent across any outlet due to standard ingredients and methods, so too can developers ensure their applications run consistently on different platforms with Docker.

Analogy: Imagine you're in charge of a pizza restaurant chain. You want all your branches to serve customers the same quality pizza every time they order. To achieve this consistency, you create recipes for each type of pizza that include ingredients, cooking times, and oven temperatures. This way, no matter which branch someone visits, the pizza served is always deliciously cooked using a consistent recipe. Similarly, Docker provides developers with standard recipes (called images) to package their applications consistently across different platforms.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
1. Debate Topic: "Should Docker be used for application deployment in production environments?"
	* Strengths of Docker include ease of use, reliability, and efficient resource utilization. However, weaknesses include potential security risks from using containers within a network and the challenges around updating or upgrading containerized applications.
2. What If Scenario Question: Imagine that you are part of a team developing an e-commerce website. Your team has decided to use Docker for application deployment in production environments because it allows you to package your code, libraries, and dependencies into containers. However, as you begin testing the system, you notice occasional slowdowns in performance during peak shopping periods. In order to improve the user experience, should your team prioritize container updates over other improvements such as optimizing database queries or improving server response times?

## Teaching Module: Singularity
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

The Problem (Event): Imagine you are part of a team working on a complex scientific simulation. Your software requires specific versions of libraries and dependencies to run correctly, but these require regular updates from different sources. As your team works tirelessly on the project, they struggle with managing the numerous version conflicts that arise due to using multiple software packages in their environment.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Enter Singularity, a solution designed specifically for HPC clusters and aimed at providing secure execution environments for applications running inside containers. It offers an easy-to-use container toolkit that simplifies deployment by allowing users to package their applications with all dependencies into one single file. This efficient method of packaging ensures consistency across different systems while reducing the risk of conflicts between software versions.

The Impact (Meaning): Singularity's significance in this scenario lies in its ability to streamline scientific simulations and other complex projects, saving time and effort for HPC teams managing diverse environments with various dependencies on multiple libraries. It allows users to focus on their work by resolving version control issues that would typically arise when dealing with software packages across different sources.

2. Storytelling Hooks:

- Dramatic Question: "Can simplifying package management in high performance computing make a world of difference for scientific simulations?"
    Point of View: From the perspective of an HPC team member experiencing challenges due to version conflicts and dependency issues.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

- Pacing: When discussing Singularity's features, take some time to explain its container toolkit and single-file executable format that allows for easy packaging and deployment. 
    Analogies: An analogy could be "Singularity is like a magic box that can hold all your project's needs - from software packages to dependencies - while ensuring consistency across different systems."

### Interactive Activities for Singularity
1. Debate Topic: "Will Singularity Enhance or Hinder Humanity?"

Statement: The Singularity will result in exponential technological progress leading to human enhancement but also pose significant risks for humanity's survival, security, and moral fabric.

Weaknesses:
- Existential Risks: The Singularity may inadvertently create unintended consequences with dire implications for humanity's survival, such as self-replicating AIs or superintelligent machines outpacing human control.
- Moral and Ethical Dilemmas: With the potential to enhance human bodies or minds, there could be issues related to fairness, inequality, and the ethical responsibilities of creating powerful technologies.

2. What If Question: "If a Singularity occurred without proper oversight, how would humanity respond to unintended consequences?"

Scenario: Imagine that a Singularity occurs before comprehensive governance systems are in place for controlling exponentially advancing technology. A self-improving AI builds another even more advanced AI friend which creates an economic and political superstructure beyond the reach of human control. Human society struggles with maintaining order, ethics, and basic survival needs due to this rapidly evolving technological landscape. Students need to justify their opinions on what could be done by humanity to regain control over its destiny in such a scenario, emphasizing the importance of ethical governance and long-term planning for emerging technologies.
