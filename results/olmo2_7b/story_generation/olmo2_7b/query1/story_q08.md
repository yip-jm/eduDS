# Lesson Plan Outline

## **Lesson Title:**
Comparing Cloud Computing and Grid Computing: From Static to Elastic

## **Introduction (Hook):**
Objective: Engage students by discussing how cloud computing revolutionizes resource sharing compared to the older grid computing model, particularly focusing on the transition from static X.509 access in grids to the dynamic pay-per-use billing of clouds.

## **Core Content Delivery:**

1. **Grid Computing Overview:**
   - Objective: Understand the foundational concepts and limitations of grid computing.
   - Key Points:
     - Definition and history of grid computing.
     - Characteristics (e.g., distributed resources, heterogeneous systems).

2. **Cloud Computing Overview:**
   - Objective: Define cloud computing and its key differences from grid computing.
   - Key Points:
     - Definition and key characteristics (e.g., on-demand self-service, broad network access).
     - Evolution from utility computing to Platform as a Service (PaaS).

3. **Comparison of Resource Control Methods:**
   - Objective: Contrast the resource control methods in grid vs. cloud computing.
   - Key Points:
     - Grid's X.509 access controls and its limitations.
     - Cloud's pay-per-use model and elasticity.

4. **Transition from Grid’s X.509 Access to Cloud’s Pay-Per-Use Elasticity:**
   - Objective: Explain the transition in terms of access control and billing.
   - Key Points:
     - The move towards flexible, scalable billing models.
     - How cloud computing's elastic nature enhances resource management.

## **Key Activity/Discussion:**

**Objective:** Encourage active learning through a class discussion or group activity where students role-play as cloud service providers and users to understand the benefits of pay-per-use elasticity over static X.509 access controls.

## **Conclusion & Synthesis:**

Objective: Summarize the lesson, reinforcing the understanding that cloud computing's pay-per-use elasticity and flexible billing model significantly outperform grid computing’s static X.509 access and inflexible resource allocation. Connect back to the original question by highlighting the real-world implications and future trends in computing resource management.
