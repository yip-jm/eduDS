# Lesson Plan Outline

## Lesson Title: From Monoliths to Microservices: The Journey to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

### Introduction
- **Hook**: Begin with a real-world scenario where a large enterprise struggles with the maintainability and scalability of their monolithic architecture, introducing the need for SOA.

### Core Content Delivery

1. **Historical Context of SOA**
   - Objective: Understand the evolution from monolithic to SOA.
   - Monolithic architectures explained.
   - The challenges faced by large-scale monolithic applications.

2. **Principles of SOA**
   - Objective: Define SOA and its principles.
   - Emphasis on stateless design for scalability.
   - Introduction to interface abstraction for standardized communication.

3. **Role of Service Brokers**
   - Objective: Explain how service brokers facilitate service discovery.
   - Discuss the benefits of decoupling services through brokers.

### Key Activity/Discussion

- **Class Debate**: Divide the class into groups and have them argue for or against adopting SOA in a hypothetical enterprise scenario. This promotes critical thinking and engagement with the material.

### Conclusion & Synthesis

- **Synthesis**: Summarize how SOA addresses the limitations of monolithic architectures, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.
- **Call to Action**: Encourage students to think about real-world applications of SOA and consider its implications for future software development.
