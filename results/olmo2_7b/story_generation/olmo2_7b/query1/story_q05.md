# Lesson Plan Outline

## 1. Lesson Title
**The Evolution of Service-Oriented Architecture in Modern Applications**

## 2. Introduction (Hook)
Objective: Engage students with the real-world challenge of designing scalable, maintainable systems by exploring the shift from monolithic to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).

## 3. Core Content Delivery
1. **Evolution from Monolithic to SOA**: Discuss how monolithic systems have evolved due to scalability and maintainability issues into more distributed SOA architectures.
2. **Importance of Statelessness**: Explain why statelessness is crucial for SOA's scalability and how it affects service interactions.
3. **Abstraction through Interfaces**: Highlight the concept of abstraction and how it hides implementation details from clients, promoting loose coupling.
4. **Role of Brokers in Service Discovery**: Describe the function of brokers and their role in facilitating service discovery within a distributed system.

## 4. Key Activity/Discussion
Objective: Encourage students to participate in a group discussion or activity where they identify the pros and cons of stateful vs. stateless services in a SOA environment.

## 5. Conclusion & Synthesis
Objective: Summarize the key takeaways and connect back to the Overall Summary, reinforcing the importance of understanding these concepts for designing robust, scalable software systems.
