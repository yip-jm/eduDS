# Lesson Plan Outline

## 1. **Lesson Title**: Scaling and Automation in Cloud-Native Computing: The Microservices and Container Revolution

### 2. **Introduction (Hook)**
Objective: Engage students with the transformative impact of cloud-native design on companies like Netflix and Uber.

- "Imagine you could instantly scale a service from a few users to millions without breaking a sweatâ€”how would your app change?"

## 3. **Core Content Delivery**

1. **Principles of Cloud-Native Design**
   - Objective: Understand the fundamental shift from monolithic to microservices architectures.
   - Discuss the benefits such as elastic scaling and rapid deployment.

2. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Objective: Define microservices, their characteristics, and the motivation behind them.
   - Explore how Netflix's transition exemplifies these principles.

3. **Container Technologies**
   - Objective: Explain containerization with Docker and its significance in cloud-native environments.
   - Demonstrate how Docker images encapsulate applications for consistent deployment.

4. **Orchestration Tools (Kubernetes)**
   - Objective: Introduce Kubernetes as the de facto orchestration tool for managing containerized workloads.
   - Highlight key concepts such as pods, services, and deployments.

5. **The CNCF Stack Definition**
   - Objective: Define the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's stack and its importance in standardizing cloud-native technologies.
   - Discuss how this stack supports interoperability among different tools.

6. **Case Studies from Netflix and Uber**
   - Objective: Analyze real-world examples of cloud-native design from Netflix and Uber.
   - Explore how these companies leverage the principles discussed to achieve their technological feats.

## 4. **Key Activity/Discussion**

Objective: Encourage student interaction and understanding through a collaborative activity or discussion.

- "In groups, brainstorm and design a cloud-native application for a small business, identifying the technologies and processes you would use."

## 5. **Conclusion & Synthesis**

Objective: Review the core concepts, reinforce learning, and connect back to the overall summary.

- Recap the transformative power of cloud-native computing and its practical applications.
- Encourage students to reflect on how these principles could influence future technology developments.
- "Think about how understanding cloud-native design might affect your approach to developing or scaling software in the real world."
