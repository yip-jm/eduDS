# Lesson Plan Outline

## Lesson Title: The Power of Containers: Docker, Singularity, and Linux Containers Compared

### Introduction (Hook)
Objective: Engage students with a real-world scenario about how containerization technologies like Docker, Singularity, and Linux Containers revolutionize software deployment in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

### Core Content Delivery
1. **Overview of Containerization**
   - Define containers and differentiate them from virtual machines.
2. **Docker: The Industry Standard**
   - Discuss Docker's features, including its use of images and containers, Docker Hub, and Docker Compose.
3. **Singularity: A Unique Approach**
   - Highlight Singularity's strengths, such as ease of use on HPC clusters and native support for multi-node applications.
4. **Linux Containers (LXC)**
   - Explain LXC's lightweight nature and its integration with Linux kernels, providing a foundation for Docker.

### Key Activity/Discussion
Objective: Facilitate a group activity where students compare features, advantages, and use cases of each container technology through a comparative chart or Venn diagram.

### Conclusion & Synthesis
Objective: Summarize the key differences and similarities among Docker, Singularity, and Linux Containers, reinforcing their importance in HPC scenarios and their departure from traditional virtualization methods. Encourage students to reflect on how these technologies impact software development and deployment processes in a modern computing environment.
