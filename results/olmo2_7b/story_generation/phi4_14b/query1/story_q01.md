# Lesson Plan Outline

## Lesson Title:
**Exploring Virtualization Techniques: Full Virtualization, Para-virtualization, and Hardware-Supported Virtualization**

## Introduction (Hook)
- **Objective:** Engage students by presenting a real-world scenario where virtualization is crucial, such as cloud computing's role in enabling scalable IT infrastructure.

## Core Content Delivery
1. **Introduction to Virtualization**
   - **Objective:** Define virtualization and explain its significance in modern computing environments.
   
2. **Full Virtualization**
   - **Objective:** Describe how full virtualization works by fully simulating hardware, allowing unmodified OSes to run on it.

3. **Para-virtualization**
   - **Objective:** Explain para-virtualization's approach using a modified OS for improved efficiency with some hardware support.
   
4. **Hardware-Supported Virtualization**
   - **Objective:** Illustrate how this technique leverages CPU features to enhance performance and reduce overhead.
   
5. **Role of Hypervisors**
   - **Type 1 Hypervisors (Bare Metal)**
     - **Objective:** Discuss Type 1 hypervisors' architecture, advantages, and typical use cases.
   - **Type 2 Hypervisors (Hosted)**
     - **Objective:** Explain the operation and applications of Type 2 hypervisors, contrasting them with Type 1.

6. **Performance Implications**
   - **Objective:** Analyze how each virtualization method impacts system performance, including considerations for resource allocation and efficiency.

## Key Activity/Discussion
- **Objective:** Conduct a group activity where students compare and contrast the three types of virtualization using case studies or simulations to solidify understanding.

## Conclusion & Synthesis
- **Objective:** Summarize key points by revisiting how full, para-, and hardware-supported virtualization differ in their approach and impact on performance, tying back to the overall importance of virtualization techniques.
