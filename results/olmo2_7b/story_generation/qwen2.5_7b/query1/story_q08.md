# Lesson Title: Cloud vs. Grid: Understanding Resource Control in Modern Computing

## Introduction (Hook)
Objective: To engage students with a real-world problem by posing the original question: "How does cloud computing differ from grid computing, and what are the implications of their resource control methods?"

## Core Content Delivery
1. **Overview of Grid Computing**: Objective: Introduce the concept of grid computing and its historical context.
2. **Resource Control in Grid Computing**: Objective: Explain how grid computing manages resources using techniques like X.509 access control.
3. **Introduction to Cloud Computing**: Objective: Define cloud computing and discuss its evolution from grid computing.
4. **Key Features of Cloud Computing**: Objective: Outline the main characteristics of cloud computing, focusing on pay-per-use elasticity.

## Key Activity/Discussion
Objective: Facilitate a group discussion comparing and contrasting resource control methods in grid and cloud computing to reinforce learning.

## Conclusion & Synthesis
Objective: Recap the differences between grid and cloud computing, emphasizing the transition from X.509 access to pay-per-use elasticity as highlighted in the overall summary.
