# Lesson Title: Embracing Cloud-Native Design: Microservices and Beyond

## Introduction (Hook)
Objective: To engage students by posing the original question about how companies like Netflix and Uber achieve rapid deployment and elastic scaling through cloud-native design.

> How can we make our applications more resilient, scalable, and easier to maintain in a dynamic cloud environment?

## Core Content Delivery
1. **Introduction to Microservices**
   Objective: Define microservices and explain their role in breaking down monolithic architectures for better scalability and flexibility.
   
2. **Containerization with Docker**
   Objective: Introduce Docker as the standard tool for containerizing applications, focusing on its benefits such as portability and isolation.

3. **Orchestration Tools: Kubernetes**
   Objective: Explain how Kubernetes manages and scales containerized applications across clusters of machines, ensuring reliability and efficiency.
   
4. **CNCF's Stack Definition**
   Objective: Outline the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) stack, highlighting key components like container runtimes, orchestration tools, service meshes, etc.

5. **Real-World Examples from Netflix and Uber**
   Objective: Provide insights into how Netflix and Uber leverage cloud-native practices to achieve their specific business goals of rapid deployment and elastic scaling.

## Key Activity/Discussion
Objective: To engage students in a discussion about the benefits and challenges of adopting microservices and containerization for real-world applications.
   
> In small groups, discuss potential use cases where microservices might be beneficial or challenging. Share examples from Netflix and Uber to explore their strategies and outcomes.

## Conclusion & Synthesis
Objective: To summarize key takeaways and connect back to the overall summary, reinforcing how cloud-native design principles enable modern application development for dynamic environments.
   
> Summarize todayâ€™s lesson by emphasizing how microservices, containerization with Docker, Kubernetes orchestration, and other CNCF tools work together to achieve elastic scaling, rapid deployment, and automation in real-world applications like those seen at Netflix and Uber.
