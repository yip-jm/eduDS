## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine a bustling city with multiple levels of responsibility and authority. In this city, there's a cloud service provider who builds skyscrapers to host companies' digital data. However, the buildings themselves come with security measures like firewalls and access controls. Now, picture these companies—let’s call them "TechCo"—moving their operations into these skyscrapers. The problem arises when both parties (the city and TechCo) don’t clearly understand who is responsible for which parts of the building's security. Without a clear division of responsibilities, there could be gaps in security that leave everyone vulnerable.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a fire breaks out in one of the buildings due to an overlooked security flaw. Both the city and TechCo are quick to blame each other for not maintaining their part of the responsibility. This incident led to a realization: without a clear and defined framework that delineates responsibilities, misunderstandings can lead to significant security lapses.

Enter the **Shared Responsibility Model**. This model is like a contract signed between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the user (TechCo). It clearly divides who is responsible for which aspects of security. The CSP takes care of securing the infrastructure—like ensuring that the building's firewalls are up-to-date and that the elevators have proper access controls. On the other hand, TechCo is responsible for securing their own data and applications within those spaces—like installing fire suppression systems in their offices.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The impact of this model is profound. It ensures clarity about what each party needs to do to secure their part of the digital landscape. This reduces misunderstandings and overlapping efforts, making security more efficient and effective. However, it also means that both parties must be vigilant and take responsibility for their own parts of the system.

## Teaching Module: Identity and Access Management (IAM)
### The Story

#### The Problem (Event)
In a bustling tech company, the CTO was faced with an unsettling problem: sensitive data was being accessed by unauthorized personnel in their cloud environment. Every day, there were reports of security breaches and confidential information leaking out into the wrong hands. The trust among partners and customers started to erode, leading to financial losses and damage to reputation. It was clear that something needed to be done.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One fateful morning, during a brainstorming session, the CTO stumbled upon an idea that seemed almost too simple to be true: **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**. IAM is like a digital castle wall; it ensures only those who should have access can enter by managing their identities and permissions. By implementing IAM, every user or system trying to access sensitive data must first prove they are who they claim to be—just as you might show an ID before entering a secure building.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Implementing IAM was revolutionary for the company. It dramatically reduced unauthorized access, ensuring that only authorized users could interact with critical data. However, this solution came with its own set of challenges. While IAM significantly enhanced security, it also introduced complexity in managing user identities and permissions across various systems. The trade-offs were clear: while the risk of breaches was minimized, the administrative overhead increased.
