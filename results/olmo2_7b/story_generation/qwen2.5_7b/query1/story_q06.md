# Lesson Title: Evolving Architectures: From Monoliths to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

## Introduction (Hook)
Objective: Introduce students to the challenge of scaling monolithic applications and why SOA was developed as a solution.

- **Introduction**: Present a scenario where a company's existing monolithic application faces severe performance bottlenecks during peak hours, leading to questions about how modern architectures can address these issues more effectively.

## Core Content Delivery
Objective: Outline key concepts in the logical progression of understanding Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).

1. **Monolithic Architectures Overview**: Define and explain what monolithic architectures are, their strengths, and their limitations.
2. **Evolving to SOA - Stateless Design**: Discuss how SOA introduces a stateless design approach to enhance scalability and maintainability.
3. **Interface Abstraction in SOA**: Explain the concept of interface abstraction and its role in making services more modular and easier to integrate.
4. **Service Discovery with Brokers**: Introduce service brokers and their importance in enabling seamless communication and discovery between different services.

## Key Activity/Discussion
Objective: Engage students through an interactive discussion or activity that reinforces understanding.

- **Discussion**: Organize a group discussion where students brainstorm potential solutions for the company's monolithic application scaling issues, then compare those solutions with SOA principles discussed in class.

## Conclusion & Synthesis
Objective: Recap and connect the lesson back to the Overall Summary, emphasizing the benefits of SOA over traditional monolithic architectures.

- **Summary**: Summarize how SOA addresses the limitations of monolithic systems by introducing stateless design, interface abstraction, and service brokers. Emphasize these concepts' role in achieving scalable and maintainable software solutions.
