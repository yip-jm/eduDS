# Lesson Title: Exploring Modern Containerization Technologies in High-Performance Computing

## Introduction (Hook)
Objective: To engage students by posing a real-world problem related to deploying applications across different environments.

How do containerization tools like Docker, Singularity, and Linux Containers help ensure consistent application deployment and management in high-performance computing clusters?

## Core Content Delivery
Objective: To logically present the core concepts of each containerization technology, highlighting their unique features and applicability in HPC scenarios.

1. **Overview of Virtualization vs. Containerization** - Introduce traditional virtualization methods and contrast them with containerization.
2. **Docker Overview** - Discuss Docker’s key features, such as ease of use and wide ecosystem support.
3. **Singularity Overview** - Explore Singularity’s unique strengths, particularly in bioinformatics and scientific research environments.
4. **Linux Containers (LXC) Overview** - Explain the basics of LXC and its role in containerization on Linux systems.
5. **Comparative Analysis** - Compare Docker, Singularity, and LXC based on their features, ease of use, performance, and HPC suitability.

## Key Activity/Discussion
Objective: To facilitate an interactive segment that reinforces learning through discussion or a hands-on activity.

### Activity: Containerization Case Study Discussion
- Divide students into small groups and provide case studies where each container technology is used.
- Each group will present their findings on which technology would be best suited for the given scenario, discussing pros and cons based on the class's comparative analysis.

## Conclusion & Synthesis
Objective: To summarize key points and connect back to the overall lesson objectives.

How do Docker, Singularity, and Linux Containers offer distinct advantages in containerization, and what factors should be considered when choosing a technology for high-performance computing environments?
