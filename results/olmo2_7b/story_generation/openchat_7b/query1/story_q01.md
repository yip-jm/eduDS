 # Lesson Title: Mastering Virtualization Techniques: Full, Para-Virtualization, and Hardware-Supported Virtualization

## Introduction (Hook)
Objective: Explore the challenges faced by IT professionals in managing multiple operating systems and introduce the concept of virtualization as a potential solution.

## Core Content Delivery
1. **Definition of Virtualization**: Define virtualization and its importance in modern computing, and explain how it simplifies system management.
2. **Full Virtualization**: Explain how full virtualization fully simulates hardware, allowing any operating system to run on a host without modification.
3. **Para-Virtualization**: Describe para-virtualization's efficiency by modifying the OS for better performance while still leveraging hardware support.
4. **Hardware-Supported Virtualization**: Introduce hardware-supported virtualization, which uses CPU features to improve performance and security in virtual environments.
5. **Hypervisors (Type 1 & Type 2)**: Detail the role of hypervisors in managing virtual machines, distinguishing between Type 1 (bare-metal) and Type 2 (hosted) hypervisors.
6. **Performance Implications**: Discuss performance differences among full, para-, and hardware-supported virtualization, including trade-offs and advantages.

## Key Activity/Discussion
Objective: Engage students in a group discussion to brainstorm real-world applications of virtualization techniques.

## Conclusion & Synthesis
Objective: Summarize the lesson by connecting back to the Overall Summary and emphasizing the importance of understanding different virtualization techniques for modern computing environments.
