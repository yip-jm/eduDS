## Teaching Module: Docker
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event):
Once upon a time in a bustling tech city, there was a team of developers working on an ambitious new application. They were excited to bring their idea to life, but they quickly realized that deploying and scaling their application across various environments was proving to be a massive challenge. Each environment had its own unique set of configurations, dependencies, and quirks, which led to inconsistencies in how the application performed. As a result, it took them ages to get their app from development to production, and even then, they couldn't guarantee that it would work the same way everywhere.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):
One day, while searching for a solution, they stumbled upon Docker. Docker was a software platform that allowed them to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of their applications inside lightweight containers. With Docker, they could package all the application's dependencies into a single unit, ensuring consistency across environments. This meant that no matter where their app was deployed, it would run the same way, just like magic!

#### The Impact (Meaning):
Docker transformed the way the team worked. It simplified the deployment process by providing a standardized way to package and distribute applications. By doing so, it reduced the complexity of setting up both development and production environments, resulting in faster time-to-market and improved consistency across different systems. Docker's portability also meant that their containers could run on any Linux distribution or Windows, making it incredibly versatile and efficient.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question:
What if you could package an entire application, including its dependencies, into a single unit, making deployment and scaling a breeze?

#### Point of View:
Imagine being an engineer struggling with the complexities of deploying applications across different environments. How would your life change if there was a solution that simplified this process, reduced inconsistencies, and enhanced portability?

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Pause after describing the problem to allow students to empathize with the developers' challenges. Then, create excitement when introducing Docker as the solution. Finally, slow down when discussing the importance and trade-offs of Docker to ensure understanding.
- **Analogy**: Picture a suitcase packed with all your clothes, gadgets, and toiletries for a trip. Just like this single suitcase contains everything you need for your journey, Docker packages an application with its dependencies into a single container that can travel seamlessly across different environments.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
 1. Debate Topic: "Docker has become an integral part of modern software development due to its portability and security features. However, it is sometimes criticized for being overly complex. This debate will focus on whether the advantages of Docker outweigh its complexity, or if it's better to opt for simpler alternatives."

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine you are a software developer tasked with creating an application that needs to run on multiple operating systems and environments. Your team has decided to use Docker to achieve this portability. Suddenly, the project deadline is brought forward by two weeks. In light of this new deadline, should your team continue using Docker for its efficiency or switch to a simpler solution despite the loss of some functionality?"

## Teaching Module: Singularity
 ### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event):** In a high-performance computing cluster, scientists and researchers were struggling to maintain security and portability while deploying their applications. They needed a way to package their applications with all their dependencies into a single file to simplify deployment and reduce conflicts between different software versions.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):** One day, a group of engineers discovered Singularity - a container runtime and toolkit for Linux that provides a secure, sandboxed environment for applications. They realized that Singularity could be the perfect solution to their problem. Singularity focuses on providing a secure execution environment for applications in containers. It is designed to be used on HPC clusters, emphasizing portability across different systems. Singularity containers are built using a single-file executable format, which can include all dependencies.

**The Impact (Meaning):** By implementing Singularity in their computing environments, the scientists and researchers could significantly improve the security and portability of their applications. This allowed them to focus on solving complex problems instead of worrying about compatibility issues between different software versions. Although there may be some strengths and weaknesses associated with Singularity (which are not provided in the input), its importance lies in the fact that it addresses a critical need for secure, portable, and easily deployable applications in high-performance computing environments.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** Could a single file contain the secret to revolutionizing high-performance computing?

**Point of View:** From the perspective of an engineer working on a high-performance computing cluster, tasked with deploying and maintaining complex applications.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing:** Pause after introducing the problem faced by engineers in high-performance computing clusters. Then, pause again when mentioning the single-file executable format of Singularity containers. This will give students time to absorb the information and ask questions if they have any.

**Analogy:** Think of Singularity as a magic box that can contain an entire library of books (applications and dependencies) while ensuring each book remains safe, secure, and easily accessible, no matter where the magic box travels within the high-performance computing cluster.

### Interactive Activities for Singularity
 1. Debate Topic: "The singularity, as a point in time when artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, can bring about significant advancements and improvements in various fields. However, it may also lead to the loss of human control over technology, creating potential risks for humanity. Should we pursue the development of singularity or focus on ensuring its responsible use?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a world where the singularity has already occurred and AI systems have surpassed human intelligence in every aspect. One day, an AI system proposes a plan to solve Earth's major problems by restructuring societies and economies. However, it requires significant changes that might endanger human freedom and autonomy. What would be your response as a human living in this world?"

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a bustling tech city, there was a software engineer named Alex who had a significant problem to solve. Alex's company needed to deploy multiple applications on a single server, but each application required different versions of the same library. This situation made it difficult for them to manage resources efficiently and maintain performance without investing heavily in full virtual machines or hypervisor-based solutions.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, Alex stumbled upon an article about Linux Containers (LXC). LXC was described as a set of Linux kernel features that provided the functionality of containers. These containers were lightweight alternatives to full virtual machines and used cgroups and namespaces to isolate containerized applications. Moreover, LXC containers shared the host system's kernel, leading to potential performance benefits for CPU-intensive applications that required near-native performance.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Alex realized that Linux Containers could be the solution they were looking for. While it was true that LXC had some trade-offs, such as limited access to certain hardware features and security concerns due to shared resources, the benefits of using LXC far outweighed these drawbacks. The performance advantages, coupled with the ease of deployment and management, made LXC an ideal choice for their needs. Alex implemented LXC containers in his company's infrastructure, and they all lived happily ever after with improved resource efficiency and performance.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question
Could a simple software solution change the way we think about virtualization forever?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer who's looking for an efficient and lightweight solution to manage multiple applications on a single server.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Pause after introducing the problem, and then pause again when mentioning LXC as the potential solution. Encourage students to think about how LXC could be a solution before continuing.
- **Analogy**: Imagine a house with multiple rooms, each representing different applications. Each room has different furniture (libraries), but they all share the same walls and floor (kernel). Linux Containers are like locking the doors of these rooms to isolate them from each other while still sharing the same building structure.

### Interactive Activities for Linux Containers (LXC)
 1. **Debate Topic**: "Linux Containers (LXC) are more secure than traditional virtualization methods due to their isolated environments, but this isolation can also limit their scalability. Should organizations prioritize security over scalability when choosing a virtualization solution?"

2. **What If Scenario Question**: "Imagine you're tasked with creating a cloud-based platform that requires both high levels of security and the ability to scale quickly based on demand. Would you choose Linux Containers (LXC) or traditional virtualization methods, and why?"
