 ## Lesson Title: Exploring Cloud Computing vs Grid Computing: A Comparative Study

1. **Introduction (Hook)**: Students will analyze a real-world example of a company transitioning from Grid computing to cloud computing, sparking curiosity about the advantages and disadvantages of each model.
2. **Core Content Delivery**: 
   - I. Differentiate between Grid Computing and Cloud Computing in terms of architecture, resource allocation, and access control.
   - II. Compare resource control methods, such as pay-per-use elasticity in cloud computing and X.509 access in grid computing.
   - III. Discuss the transition from Grid's X.509 access to cloud's flexible billing systems, emphasizing the benefits of pay-per-use models.
3. **Key Activity/Discussion**: Students will work in groups to analyze a case study comparing two organizations: one using Grid computing and another using Cloud computing, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each model based on the concepts learned.
4. **Conclusion & Synthesis**: Students will reflect on the overall summary, connecting the differences between Grid Computing and Cloud Computing to their potential impact on modern technology and industry.
