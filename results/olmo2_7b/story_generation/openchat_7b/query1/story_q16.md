 # Lesson Title: Hypervisor Virtualization: Unraveling Memory and I/O Virtualization Techniques

1. **Introduction (Hook)**: Understand memory and I/O virtualization in hypervisors through a real-world scenario of running multiple operating systems on the same hardware without interference.
2. **Core Content Delivery**: 
   1. Shadow Page Tables: Explain how shadow page tables are used to maintain separate virtual address spaces for each VM, isolating them from one another and improving system performance.
   2. Memory Management Units (MMUs): Discuss the role of MMUs in translating virtual addresses to physical addresses, managing memory mappings efficiently, and its impact on system performance.
   3. Device Emulation: Illustrate how device emulation allows VMs to access hardware resources by creating abstract representations, enhancing security and isolation between VMs.
3. **Key Activity/Discussion**: Conduct a group activity where students simulate the process of memory and I/O virtualization in hypervisors using simple analogies or props. Then, discuss the challenges faced during the activity to deepen understanding.
4. **Conclusion & Synthesis**: Recap the importance of memory and I/O virtualization in hypervisors for creating isolated environments, improving system performance, and managing hardware resources effectively. Connect this back to the overall knowledge summary of Hypervisor Virtualization.
