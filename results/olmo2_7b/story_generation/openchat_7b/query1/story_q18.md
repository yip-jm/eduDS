# Lesson Title: Introduction to Cloud-Native Computing and Design

## Introduction (Hook): Understanding the Benefits of Cloud-Native Systems
Objective: Introduce students to the concept of cloud-native design by presenting a real-world problem that companies like Netflix and Uber have solved with this approach.

## Core Content Delivery:
1. **Microservices**: Explanation of microservices as a software development technique, breaking down complex applications into smaller, independently deployable services.
2. **Containerization with Docker**: Introduction to container technology, specifically Docker, and its role in packaging and running applications in isolated environments.
3. **Kubernetes for Orchestration**: Presentation of Kubernetes as an orchestration tool that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
4. **CNCF-defined Stack**: Overview of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) stack, which includes Kubernetes and other tools for building and managing cloud-native applications.
5. **Examples from Netflix and Uber**: Case studies of how companies like Netflix and Uber have adopted cloud-native design to achieve elastic scaling, rapid deployment, and automation.

## Key Activity/Discussion: Designing a Cloud-Native Application
Objective: Encourage students to apply their knowledge by designing a simple cloud-native application using microservices, containerization, and orchestration tools.

## Conclusion & Synthesis: The Future of Cloud-Native Computing
Objective: Summarize the key concepts covered in the lesson and discuss the future implications and trends in cloud-native computing, emphasizing its importance for modern software development.
