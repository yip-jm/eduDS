## Storytelling Module: Operating System Level Virtualisation

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the past, businesses often had to dedicate entire servers to individual users or teams, even if they only needed a fraction of the resources. This was costly and inefficient.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter operating system level virtualization. This innovative technology uses isolation mechanisms to create virtual environments on a single physical machine. Each user gets a virtual server with its own operating system, storage, and resources, simulating the dedicated server experience.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Operating system level virtualization is a gamechanger. It optimizes resource utilization by sharing the underlying OS kernel among different environments. This reduces costs, improves efficiency, and allows businesses to scale their computing power as needed. While only one type of OS can run on the host at a time, this limitation is often overcome through containerization which runs multiple isolated processes within a single OS environment.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter by sharing resources among multiple users?
* **Point of View**: Let's explore this concept from the perspective of a system administrator tasked with maximizing efficiency and reducing costs.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, starting with basic virtualization concepts before diving into OS-level virtualization. Pause after explaining the 'Aha!' moment to allow students to digest the idea.
* **Analogy**: Imagine a classroom with limited chairs. Operating system level virtualization is like creating multiple virtual classrooms within the same physical space, ensuring each student gets their own chair while efficiently utilizing the available resources.

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualisation
## Storytelling Module: Para-virtualisation

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the world of virtual machines, performance often becomes a bottleneck. With full virtualization, every interaction between the guest operating system and hardware passes through an emulation layer, adding unnecessary overhead. This can lead to sluggish machines, hindering productivity and efficiency.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter para-virtualisation. This innovative technique eliminates the need for full emulation by requiring the guest operating system to be modified to directly interact with the hypervisor through specific interfaces known as 'hooks'. This eliminates the performance penalty associated with emulation layers.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Para-virtualisation delivers significant performance gains by reducing the overhead of virtualization. This allows for faster execution of applications and a more responsive virtual environment. However, the trade-off is the need to modify the guest operating system, which can limit compatibility with certain applications or configurations.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: "Is making a computer dumber the key to making it smarter?"
* **Point of View**: "Imagine being an engineer tasked with building a virtual machine that runs as efficiently as possible."

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, highlighting the performance issues of full virtualization. Then, seamlessly transition to the solution provided by para-virtualisation. Finally, discuss the trade-offs associated with this approach.
* **Analogy**: Compare para-virtualisation to a bridge connecting two islands. The bridge (hypervisor) allows people (guest OS) to travel between the islands (hardware), but traditional bridges (emulation) can be congested, leading to delays. Para-virtualisation builds a more efficient bridge by allowing people to skip certain congestion points (hooks).

### Interactive Activities for Para-virtualisation
## Debate Topic:

**Is para-virtualisation a more viable solution for performance optimisation than full virtualization, despite the requirement for guest OS modifications?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a scenario where you need to run a mission-critical application with strict performance requirements on a large pool of heterogeneous hardware. How would you leverage para-virtualisation to achieve optimal performance while maintaining broad compatibility across the hardware?**

## Teaching Module: Hypervisor Types
## Storytelling Module: Hypervisor Types

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Virtualization was becoming increasingly popular, but performance was becoming a bottleneck. The old approach of running applications directly on the hardware was proving inefficient for the growing workload.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter the world of hypervisors! These innovative pieces of software separated the physical hardware from the operating system instances, allowing for the creation and management of multiple virtual machines. Two main types emerged: Type1 and Type2.

Type1 hypervisors run directly on the hardware, providing low-level access to control the hardware and manage guest operating systems. Conversely, Type2 hypervisors, running on a conventional operating system like any other program, offer a layer of isolation between the hardware and the virtual machines.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Understanding hypervisor types is crucial for optimizing performance in virtualization environments. While Type1 hypervisors offer better performance due to direct hardware access, they require specific system requirements. Type2 hypervisors may have higher overhead due to additional software layers, but they provide greater isolation and security.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: "Can we achieve the power of a supercomputer without actually building one?"
* **Point of View**: "Imagine you're a system administrator tasked with maximizing performance for multiple virtualized applications."

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, then delve into each type of hypervisor with specific examples. Leave space for questions and discussions.
* **Analogy**: Compare the hypervisor to a traffic controller in a city. The controller (hypervisor) manages the flow of traffic (virtual machines) through different intersections (hardware resources) while ensuring optimal performance.

### Interactive Activities for Hypervisor Types
## Debate Topic:

**Is the performance benefit of Type 1 hypervisors worth the potential compatibility limitations compared to Type 2 hypervisors?**
