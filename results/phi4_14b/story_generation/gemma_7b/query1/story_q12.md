## Teaching Module: Division of Security Responsibilities
## **1. The Story**

**The Problem (Event)**: In the cloud computing landscape, security concerns linger. Data breaches and unauthorized access threaten the integrity of sensitive information. The traditional model of security, where responsibility lies solely with the organization, proves inadequate.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter the 'Division of Security Responsibilities' concept. This innovative approach allocates security tasks between cloud providers and users across various service models. The Cloud responsibility diagram visualizes this partnership, clearly defining who's responsible for what.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: By understanding this shared responsibility, organizations can proactively address security vulnerabilities. Data owners take ownership of securing their data, while providers enhance infrastructure and service security measures. This synergy promotes a robust and resilient cloud environment.

## **2. Storytelling Hooks**

- **Dramatic Question**: "Can we outsource security without compromising control?"
- **Point of View**: "Imagine a collaborative security partnership where both parties work towards a common goal."

## **3. Classroom Delivery Tips**

- **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, building on previous knowledge of cloud computing. Pause after explaining the Cloud responsibility diagram to allow students to digest the visual representation.
- **Analogy**: Compare the division of security responsibilities to a shared responsibility for maintaining a garden. The provider supplies the tools and infrastructure (garden beds), while the user provides the expertise and care (watering, weeding).

### Interactive Activities for Division of Security Responsibilities
## Debate Topic:

**Is the explicit division of security responsibilities within an organization a more effective approach to overall security than empowering individuals with broader security mandates?**
