## Teaching Module: Hypervisor-Based Virtualization
## Storytelling Module: Hypervisor-Based Virtualization

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Imagine running a demanding scientific simulation on a powerful computer, only to discover it runs slower than anticipated. This is because the computer is juggling multiple applications and processes simultaneously, leading to performance bottlenecks.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter the world of **virtualization**. With a **hypervisor**, we can create multiple isolated environments (virtual machines) on a single physical system. Each virtual machine operates independently, with its own operating system and applications, while sharing the underlying hardware resources.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: This is a game-changer! While virtualization provides strong isolation and security, it comes with a cost. The hardware isolation can lead to performance overhead and slower booting times for virtual machines. This makes it less suitable for high-performance computing where speed is of the essence.


### 2. Storytelling Hooks

- **Dramatic Question**: Can we achieve isolation without sacrificing performance?
- **Point of View**: Let's explore the world of virtualization through the eyes of a system administrator juggling multiple applications on a single computer.


### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, starting with the problem of resource sharing. Then, present virtualization as the solution and discuss its key features. Finally, address the performance trade-offs.
- **Analogy**: Compare virtualization to renting out an apartment building. The physical hardware is the building itself, while the virtual machines are individual apartments. The hypervisor is like the landlord who ensures everyone has their own space while managing shared resources like electricity and water.
