## Storytelling Module: Docker

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Traditional virtualization relies on hypervisors, which consume resources and slow down applications. In high-performance computing (HPC), this inefficiency becomes a bottleneck.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Docker! This platform eliminates the need for hypervisors by packaging applications with all their dependencies in "containers." These containers are like mini-computers that can run independently of the underlying infrastructure.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: By avoiding the overhead of hypervisors, Docker provides:

- **Improved performance:** Reduced resource consumption and faster boot times.
- **Efficiency:** Simplified deployment and resource utilization.
- **Agility:** Faster development and deployment cycles.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

**Point of View:** Imagine you're an engineer tasked with building a scalable and efficient HPC application.


### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing:**

- Introduce the concept of virtualization and its limitations.
- Highlight the need for a more efficient solution.
- Explain Docker's core features and benefits.
- Provide practical examples of Docker in industry settings.

**Analogy:** Think of Docker like Lego blocks. You can easily assemble and disassemble them to create different applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
## Debate Topic:

**Is Docker's lightweight approach and reduced overhead a more valuable advantage than its potential lack of support for complex virtualization scenarios?**

## Teaching Module: Singularity
## Storytelling Module: Singularity

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the high-performance computing world, scientists often grapple with inconsistent performance across different systems. This inconsistency hinders collaboration and hinders research progress. Traditional container platforms designed for general-purpose environments fail to address the specific needs of HPC applications.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Singularity! Inspired by Docker's containerization approach, Singularity eliminates the need for hypervisor dependency, making it ideal for HPC environments. Its focus on portability empowers scientists to seamlessly move their applications between different systems without performance degradation.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Singularity's emphasis on portability ensures consistent performance across diverse HPC systems. This empowers researchers to focus on their scientific breakthroughs rather than technical hurdles. By offering a familiar containerization experience, Singularity simplifies collaboration and accelerates scientific discoveries.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: "Can we unlock the full potential of scientific computing by making computers dumber, not smarter?"
* **Point of View**: "Imagine you're a researcher juggling complex simulations across different systems. How do you ensure consistent performance without juggling technical complexities?"

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, explaining the challenges of HPC performance portability. Highlight the limitations of traditional containerization approaches before seamlessly transitioning to Singularity as the solution.
* **Analogy**: Compare Singularity to a standardized power outlet. Just as different devices can seamlessly connect to the outlet without worrying about compatibility issues, Singularity enables seamless container movement across diverse HPC systems.

### Interactive Activities for Singularity

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
## **1. The Story**

**The Problem (Event)**: In the world of computing, resource efficiency has always been a coveted prize. Virtualization has been a solution, but traditional VMs can be bulky and resource-intensive. This bottleneck hinders innovation and scalability in containerized environments.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Linux Containers (LXC)! Inspired by the lightweight nature of containers, LXC emerges as a revolutionary approach to virtualization. It isolates processes, hardware, and network resources, offering complete isolation without the hefty baggage of traditional VMs.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: LXC empowers developers to achieve remarkable efficiency by sharing resources seamlessly with the host machine. This eliminates the overhead associated with traditional VMs, making containerized environments leaner and more agile.

## **2. Storytelling Hooks**

* **Dramatic Question**: "Can we achieve the benefits of virtualization without sacrificing performance and efficiency?"
