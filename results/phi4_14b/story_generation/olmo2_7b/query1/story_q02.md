## Teaching Module: Operating System Level Virtualisation
### 1. The Story

**The Problem:**  
In a bustling data center, engineers faced a significant challenge. They needed to run multiple applications and services simultaneously on a single machine, each requiring its own dedicated resources and environment. **Dramatic Question**: Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

**The 'Aha!' Moment:**  
During a brainstorming session, one engineer remembered reading about *Operating System Level Virtualisation*. This concept was an **'Aha!' moment**â€”using isolation mechanisms provided by the operating system itself to create virtual environments. These virtual environments act as if they are running on separate physical machines, each with its dedicated resources. The key points were: Provides isolated virtual environments for users; Simulates the experience of using a dedicated server; Does not require modification of the guest operating system.

**The Impact:**  
This discovery was significant because it allowed multiple isolated user-space instances to run concurrently on a single physical machine, optimizing resource utilization and reducing costs. **Strengths:** It efficiently uses resources by sharing the same OS kernel among different environments. **Weaknesses:** However, it is limited to running only one type of operating system per host.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:**  
"Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?"

**Point of View:**  
From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in a bustling data center, discovering *Operating System Level Virtualisation* was like finding a hidden shortcut through a dense forest.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing:**  
Pause after explaining the **'Aha!' Moment** to allow students to digest this counterintuitive solution. 

**Analogy:**  
Compare operating system level virtualization to creating multiple rooms within a single house, where each room (virtual environment) can have its doors and windows (resources), allowing different activities without disturbing others. This analogy helps students visualize how one physical machine (house) can host several isolated environments (rooms) efficiently.

### Interactive Activities for Operating System Level Virtualisation
### 1. Debate Topic:
"Should the efficiency of operating system level virtualization outweigh its limitation to run only one OS per host in educational environments?"

### 2. What If Scenario Question:
"What if a school wants to teach both Windows and Linux operating systems to their students but only has one server? Should they rely on operating system level virtualization to achieve this goal, considering the efficiency of resource use and the limitation of running only one OS type per host?"

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualisation
### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Imagine a world where computers are like cars, but instead of engines, they have tiny drivers controlling them from the inside. These 'drivers' are the operating systems of our computers. However, each car (or computer) is trying to communicate with other cars on the road (networks), but their language and gestures (protocols) don't always match. This creates a lot of confusion and slow movement, representing the inefficiencies of full virtualization.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: One day, a brilliant engineer named Alex notices that if these tiny drivers could be given a special guidebook (modified guest OS) that taught them how to communicate more directly with the road controllers (Type1 Hypervisors), they could drive much faster and smoother. This guidebook reduces the need for translation and misunderstandings by allowing direct, optimized instructions from the controller to the driver.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: **Dramatic Question**: Could making a computer dumber (in terms of emulating full virtualization) actually make it smarter (by using para-virtualization)? **Point of View**: From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge of slow and inefficient computing due to full virtualization, para-virtualization becomes a game changer. It improves performance by directly communicating with the hardware, removing unnecessary translation layers that cause delays.

**Pacing**: Pause after explaining **The Problem** to allow students to think about the inefficiency, then quickly jump into **The 'Aha!' Moment** with excitement.

**Analogy**: **Imagine you are playing an online game where your character has to follow a lot of complex rules to move around. Para-virtualization is like giving your character a cheat sheet that tells them the quickest and most efficient way to move, bypassing some of those complex rules. It makes your character (the guest OS) faster and more responsive in the game world (hardware environment).**

### Interactive Activities for Para-virtualisation
### Debate Topic:

**Resolved:** The benefits of para-virtualization in terms of performance enhancement outweigh the drawbacks of needing modified guest operating systems."

### What If Scenario:

*Imagine you are a system administrator managing a data center with a mix of different guest operating systems. You have the option to deploy either full virtualization or para-virtualization. Which approach would you choose, and why? Explain how the strengths and weaknesses of each method impact your decision-making process and the overall performance and compatibility of your virtualized environment.*

## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: Imagine a world where each software application needs its own unique set of hardware to run efficiently. This setup leads to a cluttered IT room filled with multiple servers, each dedicated to running a single application. Software updates and changes become a nightmare, as they often require hardware modifications.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: One day, an innovative computer scientist discovered **full virtualization**. They realized that instead of modifying the hardware for every software change, they could simulate the entire hardware environment for each guest operating system. This way, any OS could run independently on top of a single hypervisor without needing adjustments.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: The discovery of full virtualization was nothing short of revolutionary. It provided **high compatibility with various guest operating systems**, enabling a single physical machine to host multiple OS environments simultaneously. However, it came with a trade-off: the overhead of simulating the complete hardware led to **higher performance overhead**.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**: "Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?" 

**Point of View**: Narrate from the viewpoint of an IT manager grappling with the limitations of physical hardware and the promise of full virtualization.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing**: Begin with the **problem** to grab attention. Then, slowly build up to the **'Aha!' Moment**, pausing to ask students if they can foresee potential solutions before revealing the concept. Conclude with the **impact** to reinforce its importance.

**Analogy**: Explain full virtualization by comparing it to a sophisticated movie set where every detail of a city street is meticulously recreated on a stage, allowing actors to perform as if they were in New York without ever leaving the studio. Just like the set simulates the real city, full virtualization creates a fake hardware environment that tricks the guest OS into thinking it has its own dedicated computer.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
### 1. Debate Topic
