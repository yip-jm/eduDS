## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
### 1. The Story

**The Problem**

Imagine this: a small business owner named Alex wanted to expand their operations online. They decided to move their website and data to the cloud to make it more accessible and scalable. However, they quickly found themselves confused about who was responsible for securing their data and ensuring it wouldn’t fall into the wrong hands.

**The 'Aha!' Moment**

One day, while seeking advice from a cloud security expert, Alex stumbled upon the concept of the **Shared Responsibility Model**. This model explained that just like when renting a house, both the landlord and the tenant have specific responsibilities—maintaining the exterior versus the interior, respectively. In the cloud, it means that **the service provider (landlord) is responsible for securing the physical infrastructure**, while **the customer (tenant) is responsible for securing their data and applications**. This realization was a turning point for Alex because it made security responsibilities clear and manageable.

**The Impact**

Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model allowed Alex to make informed decisions about their cloud security measures. It wasn’t just about trust in the cloud provider anymore; it involved actively managing security at the user level as well. This clarity led to a more secure online presence for Alex’s business, enhancing customer trust and data protection. Thus, **this model became a crucial tool** for businesses navigating the complexities of cloud security.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**

"Can you really outsource your security worries to the cloud provider, or is there a part you must play yourself?"

**Point of View**

From the perspective of an entrepreneurial business owner like Alex, grappling with the nuances of cloud security for the first time.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing**

Pause after explaining **The Problem** to give students a moment to ponder the question. Before revealing **The 'Aha!' Moment**, ask them what they think might be the solution based on their initial thoughts.

**Analogy**

Use the analogy of renting a house: the landlord maintains the exterior, while the tenant takes care of the inside. Explain that in the cloud, the provider manages the "exterior" of security (infrastructure), while the customer manages the "inside" (data and applications).

This narrative framework helps teachers explain complex concepts like the Shared Responsibility Model by weaving together a relatable story, engaging questions, and concrete analogies, making it easier for students to grasp the essence of cloud security responsibilities.
