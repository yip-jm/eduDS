## Teaching Module: Docker
### 1. The Story

**The Problem:** Before Docker, imagine a chef trying to transport a delicate dish across town. The dish is unique and needs specific ingredients arranged in a very particular way. If the dish is moved to another kitchen (a virtual machine), it might not work because the new kitchen has different conditions and tools.

**The 'Aha!' Moment:** One day, our chef learns about Docker. It turns out there's a magical box called a "container" that can transport the entire setup of the dish, including all its specific ingredients and the exact cooking instructions, to any kitchen. This way, no matter where it goes, the dish can be prepared exactly as intended.

**The Impact:** The *Impact* is profound. Now, our chef, and indeed any chef, can share their special dish with anyone anywhere, without worrying about the kitchen setup. This concept is crucial in today’s world because it allows developers to create applications that work seamlessly across different environments, making software development and deployment much more efficient and reducing the time and resources needed for setup.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** *Could packing up your software into a box make it more accessible and universal?*
