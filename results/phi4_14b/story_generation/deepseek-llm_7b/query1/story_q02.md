## Teaching Module: Operating System Level Virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

**The Problem (Event):** Imagine you're running multiple applications on your computer and need more resources like RAM to run them smoothly. You notice that even though your physical hardware is limited, there might be unused potential in the shared operating system kernel. This leaves you wondering if it would be possible to optimize resource utilization by creating separate virtual environments without modifying the guest OS.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):** Operating System Level Virtualization provides a solution for this challenge! It uses isolation mechanisms to create user-space instances on a single physical machine, similar to using a dedicated server. The operating system kernel is shared among multiple isolated environments, allowing efficient use of resources without the need for modifying the guest OS.

**The Impact (Meaning):** This concept has significant implications in today's computing world! It allows you to run several different operating systems simultaneously on one machine, optimizing resource utilization and reducing costs by consolidating hardware requirements. However, it also comes with its limitations; you can only use one type of OS per host due to the compatibility constraints.

2. Storytelling Hooks

- **Dramatic Question**: Can virtualization truly help us make better use of our limited computing resources?
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of a computer enthusiast trying to optimize their system for maximum performance.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* Pacing: Pause after explaining the concept's significance and ask students if they have any questions or thoughts on its importance before diving into further discussion about strengths, weaknesses, and applications in real-world scenarios. 
* Analogy: Imagine you have a shared house with multiple roommates who all need their own space to store belongings. Each roommate could be considered an "environment" running independently within the same physical structure (the host machine), sharing essential resources like electricity and water while still maintaining privacy and control over personal items.

### Interactive Activities for Operating System Level Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic:
"Is OS level virtualisation an effective strategy for resource sharing in today's diverse computing environments?"
Strengths: Efficient use of resources by sharing the same OS kernel among different environments.
Weaknesses: Limited to running only one type of operating system per host.

2. What If Scenario Question:
"Imagine that a school is planning to upgrade its computer labs with modern, high-performance machines. The IT department has two options - purchasing new machines preloaded with multiple OSs for diverse application needs or investing in a single machine running an OS level virtualisation software allowing the use of different operating systems on one host."

The debate topic allows students to discuss whether it's better to have separate, dedicated hardware for each type of environment (e.g., Linux servers, Windows workstations) or if using an OS level virtualisation technique like a hypervisor would be more efficient in terms of resource utilization and cost savings. The scenario question challenges them to evaluate the trade-offs between flexibility and efficiency while considering budget constraints. They will need to consider factors such as hardware requirements, software compatibility, learning curve for IT staff, and potential performance impact when making their recommendation.

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem → Solution → Impact)

---

In a world where computers were struggling to handle heavy workloads efficiently and reliably, there was an ongoing challenge that had been plaguing developers and engineers alike. These machines, which had become increasingly powerful over time, still suffered from performance bottlenecks when it came to running multiple virtual machines at once on the same hardware.

This problem was particularly challenging for those who needed to run complex or resource-intensive workloads in a secure environment that maintained strict isolation between different processes and applications. Despite the leaps forward made by virtualization technologies, full virtualization still presented significant overheads - both in terms of performance and management complexity - which hindered their efficiency.

One day, while pondering this problem during an innovation session at his company's R&D lab, Dr. John Smith stumbled upon a solution that would change the way we think about virtual machines forever. He discovered what came to be known as 'para-virtualisation'.

---

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**:

Para-virtualisation is an innovative approach to running multiple virtual machines on the same hardware platform, without relying solely on full virtualization techniques. It involves modifying a guest operating system so that it can communicate directly with a Type1 hypervisor through specific interfaces or "hooks". These hooks enable efficient machine execution simulation and significantly reduce the performance overhead associated with traditional full-system emulation.

---

**The Impact (Meaning)**:

Para-virtualisation transformed the way we think about virtual machines, offering a more performant solution for managing complex workloads in secure environments. By allowing direct communication between the guest operating system and Type1 hypervisor through hooks, para-virtualisation significantly reduces performance overheads compared to full virtualization techniques. This means that multiple virtual machines can run simultaneously on the same hardware platform without experiencing significant performance degradation.

However, one drawback is that para-virtualisation requires modification of the guest operating system, which may limit compatibility with other systems or environments. Nonetheless, this innovative approach to virtual machine management has become a critical tool in modern computing infrastructures and continues to evolve alongside advancements in virtualization technology.

### Interactive Activities for Para-virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Is para-virtualization an effective solution for improving performance in resource-intensive tasks, or should we continue with full virtualization?"
Strengths of para-virtualisation are improved performance due to reduced overhead compared to full virtualization. Weaknesses include the requirement for modification of the guest operating system and potential compatibility limitations. The debate can be framed around whether the trade-offs between performance improvements and the complexity of modifying the guest OS outweigh the benefits of a more comprehensive solution provided by full virtualization.

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine you're part of an IT team responsible for managing servers in a data centre. You are given two choices - to use para-virtualisation or continue with the existing full virtualization system. The new server has a limited budget, and your task is to decide which solution will provide better performance at a lower cost while considering both strengths and weaknesses."
The question forces students to think about real-world applications of different virtualisation techniques and how they might impact their decision-making process based on the constraints provided (budget, compatibility with guest OS). They must justify their choice by weighing the trade-offs between performance improvements, costs, and potential issues arising from modifying the guest operating system.

## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

Once upon a time, in the world of computing, there was a problem that many computer engineers and IT professionals faced. They wanted to use different operating systems on their computers without needing to modify or change any hardware. 

One day, they had an 'Aha!' moment when they discovered full virtualisation - this new concept could solve the challenge! It provides a complete simulation of all the underlying device's hardware by creating a virtual machine for each guest operating system. This way, it can run any operating system without requiring them to be aware of the hypervisor.

The impact of this discovery was enormous. Before full virtualization, running different operating systems on the same physical hardware required modifications and compatibility issues. But now, with this new technology, they could enjoy high compatibility for various guest operating systems - a game-changer! 

2. Storytelling Hooks

"How can making a computer dumber actually make it smarter? Introducing full virtualization!"

From the perspective of an engineer facing these challenges in the computing world, imagine having to switch between multiple operating systems on your desktop or laptop - you'd need some magic! And that's where full virtualisation comes into play.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips

When explaining this concept to students, start with a relatable example: think of each guest OS as an alien visitor from another planet who needs its own space and resources for survival. Full virtualization provides them their very own spaceship (virtual machine) on Earth, where they can safely coexist without any conflicts or issues between the different species!

As you teach this concept, emphasize how full virtualisation allows flexibility in using various operating systems while maintaining hardware compatibility. Share the strengths of high compatibility and contrast it with the weakness of performance overhead due to complete hardware simulation. Finally, remind students that despite these trade-offs, full virtualization is crucial for a wide range of applications, making computers smarter by allowing them to manage diverse computing environments efficiently!

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Is full virtualization worth the performance overhead for compatibility with various guest operating systems?"
Debatable Statement: The debate will focus on whether it's better to use a high compatible, but more resource-intensive full virtualisation system or a less compatible one that is lighter on resources. Participants should argue about which priority takes precedence in their classroom environments - performance efficiency or the ability to run diverse guest operating systems.

2. What If Scenario Question: "If you were given an important project with strict requirements for compatibility, but it had a deadline of two weeks from now, would you choose full virtualization even though it has higher performance overhead? Or would you opt for a lighter system that might not support all your required guest operating systems?" Students must evaluate the trade-offs between the strengths and weaknesses of full virtualisation and decide what they value more in this hypothetical situation.

This debate topic encourages students to explore the advantages of each type of hypervisor, understand the differences in performance and efficiency, and weigh the benefits against potential drawbacks. It will encourage critical thinking as they analyze both types' strengths and weaknesses and determine which approach is more suitable for different scenarios.
2. What If Scenario: "Your organization has just purchased a new server with Type1 hypervisors. However, due to budget constraints, your team must choose between using it solely for high-performance tasks or splitting its resources among multiple low-demand applications. How would you balance the need for efficiency and performance against the potential impact on system stability?"
This scenario requires students to consider various trade-offs that may arise when implementing a hypervisor type within an organization's IT infrastructure. They must weigh factors such as hardware utilization, application requirements, and resource allocation while maintaining system stability. This exercise will help students understand how critical decisions in deploying these technologies can affect overall efficiency and performance.
