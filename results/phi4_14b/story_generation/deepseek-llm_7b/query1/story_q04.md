## Teaching Module: Docker
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)

**The Problem (Event):** Imagine you are working on an important project in a computer lab with several other people using their machines simultaneously. You notice that your machine is running really slow and takes hours to complete even simple tasks. This is happening because the virtual machine settings for each user are set too high, causing overall performance degradation and slow booting times.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):** One day while browsing online, you come across a concept called Docker that can help solve this problem. Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. You learn that it supports just-in-time compilation and reduces performance degradation and slow booting times associated with VMs.

**The Impact (Meaning):** The significance of Docker lies in its ability to eliminate hypervisor dependency, which allows for more efficient resource utilization and faster deployment in HPC applications. This addresses the limitations of traditional virtualization that you've been experiencing. With Docker, your machine will be able to handle tasks much quicker, improving overall productivity.

2. Storytelling Hooks
- Dramatic Question: Can making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
---------------------------------------

In a bustling data center, servers were running countless applications simultaneously. These systems consumed resources and needed constant maintenance to run efficiently. As the workload increased, administrators found themselves in an ever-growing race against time, trying to keep up with demands for computing power. 

One day, while reviewing resource utilization logs, they stumbled upon a revelation: many of these services shared common dependencies - libraries, executables, and other files. Could there be a way to package all this shared data into one container, allowing them to run efficiently without consuming excess resources? Thus was born the 'Linux Containers (LXC)'.

2. Storytelling Hooks
-------------------
- "How can we make our servers more efficient by sharing and isolating resources in an innovative way?"
- From the perspective of a server administrator or DevOps engineer, trying to keep up with high demands while keeping costs low.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips
-------------------------
* Pacing: When discussing LXC's potential benefits, take time to highlight its efficiency and resource sharing abilities. It's important for students to fully grasp the implications of these features on a system's performance.
* Analogy: Imagine servers as houses in a neighborhood where each house has different needs but can share resources (like electricity or water) with their neighbors efficiently. This way, everyone gets what they need without wasting resources and keeping costs low.

### Interactive Activities for Linux Containers (LXC)
1. Debate Topic: "Is LXC more efficient than using traditional Virtual Machines for resource sharing?"
Statement: Linux Containers (LXC) offer efficient resource sharing and isolation capabilities without the need for hypervisors, making them a better option for certain applications compared to traditional virtual machines. However, they may lack some of the advanced features provided by traditional VMs. 
2. What If Scenario Question: "A software company is considering using LXC for their cloud infrastructure. They have been given two servers with identical hardware specifications. The first server will run as a set of Linux Containers, while the second will run on a VM hypervisor. Which server should they choose and why?" 
Answer: The students should compare the trade-offs between the two options (LXC vs traditional VMs) to determine which one is more suitable for this scenario. They would need to consider factors such as performance, resource utilization, security, maintenance, and scalability when making their decision. This exercise will encourage them to think critically about the pros and cons of each approach and how they apply to a real-world situation.

One day, while working on a complex HPC project, a team stumbled upon container-based virtualization as a solution for this problem. They realized that by using lightweight containers instead of hypervisors, they could share resources more efficiently with the host machine. This led to improved performance efficiency without sacrificing application flexibility or security.

The Impact (Why it Matters)
--------------------------

Container-based virtualization revolutionized high-performance computing environments by providing a highly efficient and flexible solution for deploying applications on shared infrastructure. It mitigates hardware penalties associated with hypervisors, allowing developers to optimize their usage of resources more effectively. This approach introduces new features that surpass those of traditional virtualization technologies, such as enhanced resource sharing capabilities and reduced performance overheads.

However, it's important to note that while container-based virtualization offers numerous benefits for high-performance computing applications, there may be some trade-offs in terms of security or isolation compared to other virtualization methods like hypervisors. Nonetheless, the impact on improved performance efficiency and resource sharing capabilities is significant enough to make this technology an indispensable tool within modern HPC environments.

Storytelling Hooks
-----------------

*Dramatic Question*: Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

*Point of View*: From the perspective of an engineer faced with optimizing hardware usage in high-performance computing environments, container-based virtualization provides a game-changing solution for improving performance efficiency and resource sharing capabilities.
