## Teaching Module: Operating System Level Virtualisation
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

**The Problem (Event):**
Imagine you're an IT manager in charge of multiple servers for your company's various departments. Each department has different software requirements and operating systems, but each server is expensive to maintain and can't be shared across teams without conflicts. This situation leads to inefficiencies, high costs, and a lot of wasted space on the physical hardware.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):**
Enter our hero, the concept of Operating System Level Virtualisation (OSL). One day, an engineer at a tech company had a brilliant idea: what if instead of running different operating systems on separate physical servers, they could run them all simultaneously on one server? This would allow for multiple isolated environments to coexist peacefully without stepping on each other's toes. The "Aha!" moment came when the engineer realized that by sharing the same OS kernel among these environments, they could create a virtual environment that simulates the experience of using a dedicated server. This is what OSL does: it provides isolated virtual environments for users, simulating the experience of using a dedicated server without requiring any modification to the guest operating system.

**The Impact (Meaning):**
This solution revolutionizes how companies manage their IT infrastructure. By allowing multiple isolated user-space instances on a single physical machine, resource utilization is optimized, and costs are significantly reduced. The strengths lie in its efficient use of resources by sharing the same OS kernel among different environments. However, it also has limitations: running only one type of operating system per host can be restrictive.

### Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

**Point of View:** From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in optimizing IT resources while maintaining flexibility and cost efficiency.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Start with the problem to set the stage. Pause here to ask, "How would you solve this?" before introducing the solution.
- **Analogy**: Think of OSL as running multiple races on one track, where each racer (environment) has its own lane but shares the same road (OS kernel). This way, they can compete without interfering with each other.

By using this structured story, teachers can engage students in understanding how Operating System Level Virtualisation addresses real-world challenges and paves the way for more efficient IT solutions.

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualisation
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

**The Problem (Event):**
In a bustling data center, servers were often underutilized because of the overhead associated with full virtualization. Each time an application needed to access hardware resources, it had to go through multiple layers of virtualization, which slowed down performance and wasted energy. The IT engineers knew they needed a better way.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):**
One day, a brilliant engineer named Alex was working on optimizing the data center's operations. While browsing through technical forums, he stumbled upon an article about para-virtualisation. This concept intrigued him because it promised to enhance performance by reducing the overhead associated with full virtualization. Para-virtualisation involved modifying the guest operating system (OS) so that it could communicate directly with a Type1 Hypervisorâ€”essentially bypassing some of those pesky emulation layers.

Para-virtualisation worked through hooks, which were like special doorways in the OS for communication with the hypervisor. These hooks allowed the guest OS to interact more efficiently with hardware resources, leading to improved performance and efficiency without needing to emulate every single piece of hardware. Alex saw this as a game-changer because it could help his data center run at its full potential.

**The Impact (Meaning):**
Para-virtualisation was significant because it offered an innovative solution to the challenges posed by full virtualization. While it required modifying the guest OS, which could limit compatibility, it dramatically reduced overhead and improved performance. By allowing direct communication between the guest OS and hypervisor, para-virtualisation bypassed some of the emulation layers that added unnecessary delays and resource usage.

### Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

**Point of View:** From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in optimizing server performance while reducing overhead, para-virtualisation offers a clever solution by simplifying communication between the guest OS and hardware resources.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Pause after explaining what full virtualization entails to emphasize its inefficiencies.
- **Analogy**: Imagine you're trying to send a message through different layers of a crowded building. Full virtualization is like sending it through many floors, each one adding time and effort. Para-virtualisation, on the other hand, is like having a direct elevator that cuts out unnecessary stops.

By using this story, students can grasp the concept of para-virtualisation more intuitively and appreciate its significance in improving system performance and efficiency.

### Interactive Activities for Para-virtualisation
### 1. Debate Topic

**Resolution:** "Para-virtualization should be widely adopted in enterprise environments despite requiring guest OS modifications."

**Team Arguments:**

- **For Para-Virtualization (Affirmative Team):**
  - Improved performance and efficiency make para-virtualization a compelling choice for resource-intensive applications.
  - The reduced overhead of para-virtualization can lead to better overall system utilization and cost savings in the long run.

- **Against Para-Virtualization (Negative Team):**
  - Guest operating system modifications are a significant hurdle, potentially limiting compatibility and increasing complexity.
  - For environments with strict security requirements or those using proprietary software, the need for OS modification could pose risks.

### 2. What If Scenario Question

**Scenario:**

Imagine your company is developing an application that requires high performance but operates on various guest operating systems. The development team has been tasked with selecting a virtualization solution to host this application in a test environment before deployment.

**Question:**

Given the strengths and weaknesses of para-virtualization, should the development team opt for para-virtualization or stick with full virtualization? Justify your choice by considering the performance requirements, the compatibility needs, and any potential risks associated with modifying the guest operating system.

## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine a scenario in a bustling data center where multiple servers are needed to run different applications and operating systems. Each application requires its own specific environment to function correctlyâ€”think of it like having separate rooms in a house, each with unique features tailored for specific activities. However, this setup is inefficient and expensive, as servers sit idle most of the time while waiting for their turn to host an application.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a brilliant engineer named Dr. Tech faced this exact challenge. She was tasked with running multiple operating systems on fewer machines without any changes to these systems. This seemed impossible because each operating system requires specific hardware configurations and drivers that couldn't be shared or abstracted away. However, after months of research, she stumbled upon the concept of **Full Virtualisation**.

Full virtualization is like having a magical room that can mimic every single detail of a different house's interior. Each guest operating system (like an OS running in this magical room) sees and interacts with what it believes to be its own dedicated hardware environment. This magic comes from a hypervisor, which sits between the physical hardware and the virtual machines, simulating all necessary components.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
This discovery was revolutionary because it allowed different operating systems to run on the same physical machine without needing any modificationsâ€”no changes were required in the guest OS itself! It brought flexibility and compatibility to a whole new level. For example, you could run Windows, Linux, and other operating systems simultaneously on one server, saving space, power, and costs.

However, this magic comes with a price. The higher performance overhead due to complete hardware simulation means that full virtualization isn't as fast or efficient as running native applications directly on the hardware. Yet, the trade-off of flexibility and compatibility often justifies this cost in many scenarios where diverse systems need to coexist efficiently.

### Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter by allowing multiple smart operating systems to run side by side?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge, how can full virtualization transform the way we think about managing and utilizing computing resources in data centers?

### Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Pause after introducing the problem (the need for efficient use of hardware) to allow students to reflect on it.
- **Analogy**: Use the analogy of having a magical room that mimics different houses. Ask, "How would you feel if your room could change its layout and features at will, allowing you to have multiple 'houses' within one space?"
- **Discussion Points**: Discuss how this concept might be applied in real-world scenarios, such as cloud computing or large enterprise data centers.
- **Questions for Pausing**:
  - Can you think of a time when having multiple operating systems running on the same hardware would be useful?
  - How does full virtualization compare to other types of virtualization (e.g., paravirtualization)?
  - What are some potential downsides or limitations we need to consider with full virtualization?

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
### 1. Debate Topic

**Topic:** "Full Virtualisation is More Valuable Despite Its Performance Overhead."

**Pro Arguments:**
- Full virtualisation supports a wide range of guest operating systems, ensuring compatibility across diverse environments.
- It provides isolation between different applications and systems, enhancing security and stability.

**Con Arguments:**
- The higher performance overhead can significantly impact the speed and efficiency of applications running in the virtual environment.
- Resource consumption is generally higher due to the need for complete hardware simulation.

### 2. What If Scenario Question

**Scenario:** Imagine you are a system administrator tasked with setting up a new data centre that needs to run multiple operating systems, including some legacy ones, along with modern applications. The data centre has limited resources and must operate efficiently while maintaining security and compatibility.

**Question:** "Given the constraints of your data centre, would you choose full virtualisation or another form of virtualisation (e.g., paravirtualisation) to meet these requirements? Justify your choice based on the strengths and weaknesses discussed."

**Instructions for Students:**
- Consider the need for running various operating systems.
- Think about the performance implications in a resource-limited environment.
- Evaluate how critical security and stability are for the applications you will run.
- Discuss whether the higher overhead of full virtualisation is acceptable given your specific needs.

This scenario encourages students to apply their understanding of full virtualisation in a practical context, weighing its benefits against potential drawbacks.

## Teaching Module: Hypervisor Types
### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

**The Problem (Event):**
Imagine you're an engineer tasked with making multiple virtual machines run smoothly on a single physical server. Each machine needs its own operating system to function properly, but running several of these systems simultaneously can put significant strain on the hardware. This is where hypervisors come into play as a solution.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):**
One day, while troubleshooting performance issues with your virtual machines, you stumble upon hypervisorsâ€”magical software that can create and run multiple virtual machines using a single physical host! There are two main types of hypervisors: Type1 (or bare-metal) and Type2 (hosted).

**Type1 Hypervisors**â€”these are like the superheroes of the hypervisor world. They run directly on the hardware, controlling it and managing guest operating systems. This direct access to the hardware means they can operate more efficiently and provide better performance.

On the other hand, **Type2 Hypervisors**, or hosted hypervisors, run just like any other application on a conventional operating system. While this might seem less efficient due to an additional layer of software, it still offers flexibility in managing virtual machines from within familiar environments.

Now, you're faced with a decision: should you go for the Type1 hypervisor's speed and efficiency or stick with the ease-of-use and compatibility offered by Type2?

**The Impact (Meaning):**
Understanding these differences is crucial. Type1 hypervisors generally offer better performance due to direct hardware access but come with higher complexity in management. Type2 hypervisors, while offering a simpler setup, introduce additional software overhead that can affect performance.

In the world of virtualization, knowing which type to choose based on your specific needs can significantly impact how well your virtual machines perform and interact with each other.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** "Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter by running multiple operating systems more efficiently?"

**Point of View:** From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in deploying a robust, efficient virtualization environment for their company's growing needs.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Start with the problem scenario to set the stage. Pause here and ask the class if they've ever faced similar challenges.
- **Analogy**: Think of hypervisors as chefs in a kitchen. Type1 is like a chef who can use all the ingredients directly from the pantry, while Type2 is a chef working from a cookbook (the operating system) that needs to go through an additional step to get those same ingredients.

Use this analogy to explain how Type1 has direct access and thus more efficiency, but Type2 introduces overhead due to the "cooking process" layer.

### Interactive Activities for Hypervisor Types
### 1. Debate Topic

**Topic:** 
"Is it more beneficial for enterprises to use Type1 Hypervisors over Type2 Hypervisors due to their performance advantages, despite the higher complexity?"

**Arguments for Type1 Hypervisors:**
- **Performance and Efficiency:** Type1 hypervisors run directly on hardware, offering better performance and resource utilization.
- **Lower Overhead:** They reduce the risk of compatibility issues that can arise from additional software layers.

**Arguments against Type1 Hypervisors (in favor of Type2):**
- **Simplicity and Ease of Use:** Type2 hypervisors are easier to install and manage, making them more accessible for non-specialist users.
- **Flexibility in Deployment:** They offer a simpler deployment process and can run on less powerful hardware.

### 2. What If Scenario Question

**Scenario:**
"Your tech-savvy friend is setting up a small business with limited IT staff but has high demands for performance and efficiency, particularly in resource-intensive applications such as virtualized databases or graphic design software."

**Question:**
"If you were advising your friend on the best type of hypervisor to use, what would you recommend? Justify your choice by considering both the strengths and weaknesses of Type1 and Type2 hypervisors. Would the business's specific needs outweigh any potential drawbacks?"

**Expected Student Response:**
- **Recommendation:** Consider recommending a Type1 hypervisor given the high performance requirements.
- **Justification:**
  - Performance and efficiency are critical for resource-intensive applications, making a Type1 hypervisor more suitable.
  - While it may require more technical expertise to set up, the benefits in terms of speed and resource management could outweigh the complexity.

This approach ensures that students critically evaluate both aspects before making a decision.
