## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
**The Story**

### 1. The Problem (Event)

It was a typical Monday morning at CloudTech, and Emma, the IT Manager, was staring at a daunting security report. Their cloud environment had been compromised due to unclear responsibilities between them and their provider. A few weeks ago, they had migrated their critical data to a public cloud platform but were now struggling with security breaches on an unprecedented scale. The ambiguity around who was responsible for what aspects of security in the cloud was causing confusion and escalating costs.

### 2. The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)

One evening, while researching ways to rectify this situation, Emma stumbled upon a concept that would change her approach to cloud security forever - the Shared Responsibility Model. This framework clearly defined how security responsibilities were divided among infrastructure providers, service providers, and users across Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings. The model explained that for a secure cloud environment, each level had to meet specific security requirements - the provider was responsible for their part of the infrastructure and services, while the user ensured the security of their data and applications.

### 3. The Impact (Meaning)

Implementing the Shared Responsibility Model at CloudTech significantly reduced ambiguity and enhanced overall security posture. It provided clear guidelines on where responsibility lay, helping both providers and customers understand their roles, which was a significant strength of this model. However, Emma realized that selecting and combining basic security blocks could be challenging for consumers without sufficient knowledge, a weakness that required careful consideration in implementation.

**Storytelling Hooks**

- **Dramatic Question**: "Can you imagine making technology more secure by dividing responsibility instead of adding more layers?"
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of an IT Manager trying to ensure the security of their company's data in a cloud environment.

**Classroom Delivery Tips**

### 1. Pacing

- Pause after describing Emmaâ€™s security concerns and ask, "Have you ever felt overwhelmed by unclear responsibilities in technology?" 
- After introducing the Shared Responsibility Model, pause again and ask students to consider how this model could simplify their understanding of cloud security.
- When discussing the impact, pause briefly for reflection: "What do we learn from CloudTech's experience with implementing the Shared Responsibility Model?"

### 2. Analogy

Imagine a house that needs maintenance. The homeowner is responsible for cleaning and minor repairs, but if you want to install new electrical wiring or plumbing, you would hire a professional electrician or plumber. Similarly, in the cloud environment, different parties are responsible for security based on their roles - infrastructure providers, service providers, and users.

This analogy can be used to explain how the Shared Responsibility Model works and why it's essential for achieving a secure cloud environment by dividing responsibilities clearly among all stakeholders involved.

### Interactive Activities for Shared Responsibility Model
Here are two distinct items:

**1. Debate Topic:**

**Title:** "Is the Shared Responsibility Model a Double-Edged Sword?"

**Debate Statement:** "The Shared Responsibility Model's clarity in dividing security tasks among providers and customers is outweighed by its complexity, making it more detrimental than beneficial for organizations without sufficient technical expertise."

**Instructions:**

*   Divide students into two teams representing either side of the debate.
*   Each team should prepare arguments to support their stance.
*   The debate will focus on evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the Shared Responsibility Model in real-world applications.

**2. What If Scenario Question:**

**Scenario:** "A small e-commerce business, GreenTech, is planning to implement a security system based on the Shared Responsibility Model. However, they are still deciding which basic security blocks to use for their online payment processing and data storage."

**Question:** "Assuming GreenTech has limited technical expertise in-house, should they prioritize the clarity of the Shared Responsibility Model's guidelines over the potential complexity of selecting and combining basic security blocks? Explain your reasoning based on the trade-offs between these two factors."

**Instructions:**

*   Students will individually or in groups discuss and propose a solution to the scenario.
*   They should consider the strengths (clarity) and weaknesses (complexity) of the Shared Responsibility Model when making their decision.
*   The goal is for students to demonstrate an understanding of how the concept can be applied in practice, weighing its benefits against potential drawbacks.

## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management
Here is the teaching story for the concept "Identity/Access Management":

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine it's a typical Monday morning at Springfield Elementary School. Mrs. Johnson, the principal, realizes that sensitive student records have been leaked online due to an unauthorized access incident over the weekend. It turns out that a former teacher had maintained access rights even after leaving the school, causing the breach. This event highlights the need for effective identity/access management.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while investigating ways to secure student data, Mrs. Johnson comes across an innovative framework called Identity/Access Management (IAM). IAM is a set of policies and technologies designed to ensure that only authorized individuals can access specific resources at the right times. It emphasizes that "data owners are responsible for securing their data by following security best practices" and leverages providers who offer identity management and access control services. With IAM, Mrs. Johnson realizes she can limit access rights based on roles within the school and set up automatic revocation of accounts upon teacher departure.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
As the new IAM system is implemented, Springfield Elementary School experiences a significant reduction in security breaches. It not only protects sensitive student information but also ensures compliance with data protection regulations. Mrs. Johnson realizes that IAM's strengths lie in its ability to prevent unauthorized access by authenticating and authorizing users, thereby maintaining data integrity and confidentiality. However, implementing such a system requires careful planning and resources, as noted in the weaknesses.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
"Can a school protect sensitive student records from being leaked online without compromising convenience for authorized staff?"
