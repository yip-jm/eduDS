## Teaching Module: Operating System Level Virtualisation
**Operating System Level Virtualisation Story Module**

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
It was a typical Monday morning at TechCorp, where I worked as an IT manager. Our company's growth had been rapid, but our server infrastructure wasn't keeping pace. We were running out of space to set up new servers for each department, and it was becoming increasingly expensive to keep upgrading hardware. It seemed like every time we needed more resources, we'd have to either buy more expensive hardware or find creative ways to repurpose what we already had.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One of my engineers came across an innovative solution that would change the way we managed our servers forever: operating system level virtualisation. This technology allowed us to create multiple isolated environments, each simulating a dedicated server, on a single physical machine! We could run multiple operating systems and applications simultaneously without having to allocate separate hardware for each one.

The concept works by using isolation mechanisms within the host operating system. It essentially creates several 'virtual machines' that can run independently of each other, sharing the same resources as if they were dedicated servers. This means we no longer need a separate physical machine for every application or user. The key benefits include:

*   Provides isolated virtual environments for users.
*   Simulates the experience of using a dedicated server.
*   Does not require modification of the guest operating system.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Implementing OS-level virtualization was a game-changer. We were able to significantly reduce our hardware costs and free up space in our datacentre, which allowed us to expand our business without breaking the bank. By optimizing resource utilization, we reduced energy consumption and minimised our carbon footprint.

However, it's worth noting that this approach does have limitations. For instance, each virtual environment can only run one type of operating system per host, which might not be ideal for businesses with diverse IT requirements.

The benefits far outweigh the drawbacks, though. With OS-level virtualization, companies like ours can enjoy:

*   Efficient use of resources by sharing the same OS kernel among different environments.
*   Significant cost savings from reduced hardware needs and lower maintenance costs.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

#### Point of View
This story is told from the perspective of an IT manager facing the challenge of rapidly growing infrastructure needs, highlighting the importance of innovative solutions like OS-level virtualization in managing such challenges effectively.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing
-   **Pause after "It was a typical Monday morning..."** to ask students if they've ever faced similar IT infrastructure challenges.
-   **Pause before explaining the concept** to gauge students' understanding of how servers and operating systems work together.
-   **Pause again before discussing the benefits and limitations**, to reflect on what they learned from the 'Aha!' moment.

#### Analogy
Imagine you're at a large music festival with different stages hosting various genres of music. Each band or performer has its own dedicated stage, but due to space constraints, all these performances are happening in the same general area (the festival grounds). In this scenario, OS-level virtualization is like having multiple soundproof rooms within that festival area. You can have a rock band playing on one side and a jazz ensemble on another, without them affecting each other's performance, just as virtual environments isolate from each other.

This analogy helps students visualize the concept of isolation and how resources can be optimized in a shared environment.

### Interactive Activities for Operating System Level Virtualisation
Here are two interactive elements based on the provided input data:

**1. Debate Topic: "Efficiency vs Isolation"**

**Debate Statement:** "The benefits of sharing an operating system kernel among different environments outweigh the limitations imposed by running only one type of operating system per host."

This statement pits the strength of efficient resource use against the weakness of limited OS types per host, allowing students to engage in a nuanced discussion about the trade-offs involved.

**Argument For:**

* Emphasize how sharing an OS kernel reduces overhead and increases overall efficiency.
* Highlight scenarios where running multiple environments on a single kernel is beneficial (e.g., development, testing).

**Argument Against:**

* Discuss potential security risks associated with shared kernels (e.g., vulnerabilities in one environment affecting others).
* Explain situations where requiring isolation between different operating systems is necessary (e.g., sensitive data storage, regulatory compliance).

**2. What If Scenario Question: "Multi-Environment Hosting Conundrum"**

A cloud hosting provider wants to offer a scalable and cost-effective solution for its customers. They have two options:

Option A: Set up a bare-metal server with multiple virtual machines running different operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux). Each VM would have its own dedicated resources.

Option B: Use an OS-level virtualization approach to host multiple environments on the same kernel, sharing system resources and reducing overhead.

**Question:** Which option do you recommend for the cloud hosting provider? Justify your choice based on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

This scenario forces students to weigh the benefits of efficient resource use against the potential drawbacks of limited OS types per host. By considering real-world applications and trade-offs, they will develop a deeper understanding of the concept and its practical implications.

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualisation
**The Story**

### The Problem (Event)
It was 2015 and the IT department of a large corporation was facing a significant challenge. They had been using virtual machines (VMs) to run multiple operating systems on their servers, but they were experiencing performance issues. Every time an application needed more resources, the VM would need to be rebooted, which took up valuable time. The team was at a loss for how to improve this situation without breaking the bank.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while working late in the office, our protagonist stumbled upon an article about a new technology called para-virtualisation. Intrigued, they dug deeper and discovered that it required modifying the guest operating system (OS) to use a set of hooks for improved machine execution simulation, enabled by Type 1 Hypervisors which run directly on the hardware. This meant that instead of emulating entire hardware layers, para-virtualisation allowed direct communication between the OS and hypervisor, bypassing some of those extra steps.

### The Impact (Meaning)
As our protagonist implemented para-virtualisation, they were amazed at how it improved performance by reducing overhead compared to full virtualization. But they also realized that this new approach required modification of the guest OS, which could limit compatibility with certain applications or systems. Despite these trade-offs, the benefits far outweighed the costs. With para-virtualisation, applications no longer had to wait for rebooting and resource allocation times were significantly reduced. This resulted in increased productivity, lower IT costs, and happier users.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**:
	+ Pause after "It was 2015 and the IT department..." to ask students if they've ever experienced similar challenges.
	+ Ask students to share their own experiences with virtualization or resource management before explaining para-virtualisation.
	+ After explaining the concept, pause again to discuss potential applications and trade-offs in class.
* **Analogy**: Imagine a restaurant trying to serve multiple dishes at once. Full virtualization is like having a chef who has to remake each dish from scratch every time it's ordered. Para-virtualisation is like having a sous chef who knows exactly what ingredients are needed for each dish, so they can be prepared quickly and efficiently.

This storytelling approach aims to engage students by making the concept relatable and concrete through a narrative, rather than simply presenting facts and figures. By using analogies and real-world scenarios, it's easier for them to grasp the underlying principles of para-virtualisation and its impact on performance and resource management.

### Interactive Activities for Para-virtualisation
Here are two interactive classroom elements based on the provided data:

**Debate Topic: "Para-virtualization is the superior virtualization method due to its improved performance, despite requiring modifications to the guest operating system."**

In this debate topic, students will take on the roles of either proponents or opponents of para-virtualization. The pro-para-virtualization team will argue that the benefits of improved performance outweigh the drawbacks of modifying the guest OS, while the anti-para-virtualization team will emphasize the limitations and potential costs associated with such modifications.

**Debate Guidelines:**

*   Each team has 5 minutes to prepare their arguments
*   Students are expected to provide evidence from industry sources or research studies to support their claims
*   The debate will consist of opening statements, rebuttals, and closing remarks
*   A designated instructor or moderator will facilitate the discussion and ensure a respectful exchange of ideas

**What If Scenario Question: "Company XYZ is planning to deploy a new cloud-based infrastructure for its growing business. However, the company's legacy operating system requires significant modifications to support full virtualization. What would you recommend: investing in para-virtualization software or migrating to a newer OS that supports full virtualization?"**

In this scenario question, students will apply their knowledge of para-virtualization and weigh its trade-offs against other alternatives. They must consider the benefits of improved performance, potential costs associated with modifying the guest OS, and the long-term implications for the company's IT infrastructure.

**What If Scenario Guidelines:**

*   Students have 10 minutes to answer the question in writing
*   Responses should include a clear recommendation supported by logical reasoning and evidence from industry sources or research studies
*   A designated instructor or moderator will review submissions, provide feedback, and facilitate a class discussion on the trade-offs involved

These interactive elements are designed to foster critical thinking, promote informed discussions, and encourage students to apply theoretical concepts in practical scenarios.

## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
**Story Module: Full Virtualization**

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
In a bustling data center, Sarah, an IT manager, was struggling to manage the diverse range of operating systems used by different departments. From Windows for marketing to Linux for development, each had its own unique requirements and quirks. Every time she needed to upgrade hardware or migrate an application, she faced a daunting task: ensuring compatibility across all these systems.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while attending a tech conference, Sarah stumbled upon a revolutionary concept – full virtualization. She learned that it was like creating a magic box around each operating system, simulating every aspect of the underlying hardware without requiring any modifications to the guest OS itself. This meant she could run any operating system on the same physical hardware without worrying about compatibility issues.

The concept worked by providing a complete hardware environment for each virtual machine, allowing multiple VMs to coexist on a single host with minimal performance overhead. The absence of hypervisor awareness also made it possible for guests to operate as if they were running directly on native hardware. This transformational idea sparked an 'Aha!' moment in Sarah's mind: what if she could create an ecosystem where every department could use its preferred OS without worrying about hardware compatibility?

#### The Impact (Meaning)
Sarah soon realized the impact of full virtualization was profound. It provided unparalleled flexibility and compatibility, allowing her to run a multitude of operating systems on the same physical hardware without modifications. This meant easier upgrades, migrations, and the ability to scale up or down as needed. However, she also noted that this high degree of simulation came at the cost of performance – there was a trade-off between flexibility and speed.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of Sarah, an IT manager facing the challenge of managing diverse operating systems in a data center.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing
- Pause after "struggling to manage the diverse range of operating systems" and ask students: "Have you ever had to deal with different software requirements in a team or project?"
- After explaining how full virtualization works, pause again and ask: "What do you think are the implications of simulating complete hardware environments for each guest OS?"
- Before discussing the impact, pause once more and pose this question: "How do you think IT managers like Sarah would benefit from such a system?"

#### Analogy
Imagine managing different operating systems as hosting guests in a large apartment building. Each guest has its unique needs (like specific decorations or dietary preferences), but they all share the same physical space (the hardware). Full virtualization is like creating separate, fully furnished apartments for each guest without needing to modify the entire structure of the building – it ensures that everyone can live comfortably without affecting the others.

This story module aims to engage students with a real-world scenario and make them understand the concept of full virtualization by its implications on IT management.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
Here are two distinct items designed for critical thinking:

**Debate Topic:**

"Full virtualization is an ideal solution for businesses looking to deploy multiple operating systems across their infrastructure due to its unparalleled compatibility with various guest operating systems, but it comes at the cost of significant performance overhead, making it a less desirable choice for organizations requiring high-speed computing."

This debate topic presents a clear, debatable statement that pits the strengths (high compatibility) against the weaknesses (higher performance overhead). Students can take on different roles and argue either in favor or against the statement, considering various perspectives and justifying their stance with evidence.

**What If Scenario Question:**

"Suppose you are the IT manager of a growing startup with multiple teams working on projects that require different operating systems. Your current infrastructure is underutilized, and you need to deploy new virtual machines within the next two weeks. However, your team's primary workload involves high-performance computing for data analytics and simulations. Which approach would you choose: full virtualization or another alternative (e.g., para-virtualization, containerization)? Justify your decision by weighing the benefits of compatibility against the potential performance costs."

This scenario question forces students to apply their understanding of full virtualization's trade-offs and make a practical decision under time pressure. Students must consider the specific needs of their hypothetical organization and justify their choice based on the concept's strengths and weaknesses, promoting critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Teaching Module: Hypervisor Types
**Hypervisor Types: The Virtualization Paradox**

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Dr. Patel, an IT manager at a large corporation, was tasked with upgrading their data center's server infrastructure to accommodate growing business demands. However, the existing hardware was outdated and struggled to meet performance requirements. Despite investing in high-end servers, they still encountered bottlenecks. It seemed that no matter what they did, they couldn't quite reach the desired speed.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while reviewing the latest advancements in virtualization technology, Dr. Patel stumbled upon a concept called hypervisors. A hypervisor is essentially software that creates and runs virtual machines by separating physical hardware from operating system instances. There are two main types: Type1 Hypervisors, which run directly on the host's hardware to control it and manage guest OSes; and Type2 Hypervisors or hosted hypervisors, which run on a conventional OS like any other program.

The lightbulb moment came when Dr. Patel realized that she could use Type1 Hypervisors to bypass the limitations of their outdated hardware by running virtual machines directly on the host's hardware. This would not only increase efficiency but also allow for better management and control over the guest operating systems.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The switch to Type1 Hypervisors was a game-changer. By leveraging direct hardware access, they were able to significantly boost performance without having to upgrade their physical infrastructure. But what made it even more impressive was that this change didn't just improve speed; it also enhanced security and flexibility. The hosted hypervisor (Type2) approach would have introduced additional layers of software, potentially increasing overhead and security risks.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could a 'dumber' computer actually make your business smarter by leveraging virtualization to its full potential?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an IT manager facing challenges in optimizing server performance and looking for innovative solutions, especially those that can improve efficiency without significant hardware upgrades.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing
- Pause after "Dr. Patel was tasked with upgrading their data center's server infrastructure" to ask students if they've ever faced similar challenges.
- Stop again after explaining the concept of Type1 and Type2 Hypervisors to let students consider how this technology could be applied in various contexts.

#### Analogy
Think of a hypervisor as a master chef who can run multiple kitchens (virtual machines) within one large kitchen (physical server). Just like a skilled chef would optimize each station for efficiency, a Type1 Hypervisor optimizes the host's hardware to manage guest OSes directly.

### Interactive Activities for Hypervisor Types
Here are two distinct items based on the provided strengths and weaknesses:

**Debate Topic:**

**"Resolution:** Type 1 Hypervisors are a superior choice for large-scale data centers due to their performance and efficiency benefits, despite the added complexity of direct hardware interaction."

This debate topic pits the advantages of Type 1 hypervisors (better performance and efficiency) against the potential drawbacks (added complexity). Students can argue both sides, weighing the pros and cons, and develop critical thinking skills by considering real-world applications.

**What If Scenario Question:**

**"A small startup with a growing workload is planning to move its virtualized infrastructure to a cloud provider. However, they have limited budget and need to ensure the highest possible performance for their mission-critical applications. Which type of hypervisor (Type 1 or Type 2) would you recommend, and why? Justify your decision by considering both the strengths and weaknesses of each option."**

This scenario question forces students to apply the concept of hypervisor types in a real-world context, taking into account the trade-offs between performance, efficiency, complexity, and cost. By justifying their choice based on the characteristics of Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors, students will develop critical thinking skills and demonstrate their understanding of the subject matter.
