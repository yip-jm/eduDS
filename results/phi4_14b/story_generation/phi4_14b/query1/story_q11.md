## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
## 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

### The Problem (Event)
In a bustling tech hub, Cloud City, companies were migrating their operations into the cloud to harness its power and efficiency. However, with this transition came an overwhelming challenge: security. In the absence of clear guidelines, businesses found themselves uncertain about who was responsible for what aspects of security in these vast digital skies. This ambiguity led to vulnerabilities, data breaches, and a growing mistrust among users and providers alike.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, amid this chaos, a group of visionary engineers gathered under the glow of their monitors, determined to find clarity amidst confusion. They devised what came to be known as the "Shared Responsibility Model." This framework was designed to define the security obligations of both cloud service providers and their customers, ensuring a secure cloud environment.

Here's how it worked: The model delineated roles between users and providers across Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings. It divided security responsibilities among infrastructure providers, service providers, and the user themselves. By meeting security requirements at all three levels—infrastructure, service, and users—a secure cloud environment could be achieved.

### The Impact (Meaning)
The introduction of this model brought a transformative change to Cloud City. With clear guidelines on the division of security tasks, both providers and customers now understood their roles with greater clarity. This enhanced the overall security posture, reducing ambiguity and fostering trust in the cloud ecosystem.

However, it wasn't without its challenges. The complexity of selecting and combining basic security blocks remained a hurdle for consumers lacking sufficient knowledge. Despite this, the model's strengths far outweighed its weaknesses, empowering businesses to navigate their cloud journeys with confidence and precision.

## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management
## The Story

### The Problem (Event)
In the bustling city of Dataopolis, sensitive information was as valuable as gold. Every day, businesses and individuals dealt with vast amounts of data that needed protection from prying eyes. However, despite having firewalls and encryption in place, unauthorized access to confidential files was a growing concern. Employees often found themselves locked out of their own systems, unable to retrieve vital information when they needed it most. The chaos reached its peak when an important client's sensitive documents were accessed by someone who shouldn't have had the key—data integrity and confidentiality were compromised.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
Amidst this turmoil, a wise old engineer named Ada discovered a revolutionary framework known as Identity/Access Management (IAM). She explained to the city council that IAM was not just another layer of security; it was an entire system ensuring that only the right people had access to the right information at the right times. Data owners were now empowered with best practices, making them responsible for securing their own data.

Ada introduced the concept through a series of workshops where service providers demonstrated how identity management and access control could be seamlessly integrated into existing systems. They explained that by verifying who was requesting access (authentication) and ensuring they had permission to use it (authorization), IAM created a dynamic defense mechanism against unauthorized users.

### The Impact (Meaning)
The impact of implementing Identity/Access Management in Dataopolis was transformative. Unauthorized access incidents decreased significantly, restoring trust among businesses and clients. Employees could now confidently work with sensitive information, knowing their data was both secure and accessible when needed.
