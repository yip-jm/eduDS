### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Pause after introducing the problem and before explaining the IAM Frameworks, allowing students to anticipate what the solution might be.
- **Analogy**: Think of IAM frameworks as a doorman for your cloud environment. The doorman checks every person that enters, making sure only authorized individuals gain access, while those who are not allowed can't get in.

### Interactive Activities for IAM Frameworks
 1. Debate Topic: "Identity and Access Management (IAM) frameworks are crucial for enhancing security, but their complexity can lead to misconfigurations that compromise the very security they aim to provide. Should organizations prioritize ease of use over robust security measures in IAM systems, or should they accept the potential risks associated with complexity in order to maintain a high level of security?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "In a hypothetical scenario, a large corporation implements an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system that provides strong identity verification and access control mechanisms but is highly complex to manage. One day, the company's cybersecurity team discovers a potential vulnerability in the IAM system that could be exploited by hackers if not addressed immediately. The CEO has to decide whether to allocate resources to fix the issue, potentially causing disruptions to daily operations, or to risk leaving the vulnerability unaddressed and prioritize business continuity. What decision should the CEO make, and why? Consider both the short-term and long-term consequences of each option."
