## Teaching Module: Operating System Level Virtualisation
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event): A Growing Challenge
In a bustling city, there was a growing demand for computer resources. Many companies and individuals needed powerful computers to run their applications, but they didn't have the budget or space for multiple high-end machines. They were facing a challenge: how could they run multiple environments on one machine without compromising performance or security?

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Discovering Operating System Level Virtualization
One day, an ingenious engineer named Alex came up with a brilliant solution. He proposed using operating system level virtualization to create isolated virtual environments on a single physical machine. His idea was simple yet powerful: by simulating the experience of using a dedicated server, he could provide users with the resources they needed without needing to modify the guest operating system.

#### The Impact (Meaning): A Game-Changer for Resource Utilization
Alex's discovery revolutionized the way computer resources were managed. Operating system level virtualization allowed multiple isolated user-space instances on a single physical machine, optimizing resource utilization and reducing costs. This efficient use of resources by sharing the same OS kernel among different environments made it a game-changer in the world of computing. However, there was one limitation: users could only run one type of operating system per host.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question:
What if we could create multiple virtual environments on one physical machine without compromising performance or security?

#### Point of View:
From the perspective of an engineer tasked with managing computer resources for a growing company.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
#### Pacing:
- Introduce the problem and the engineer's discovery, then pause to let students process the information.
- Ask questions like "How do you think Alex solved the challenge?" or "What could be the benefits of using operating system level virtualization?" after certain sections of the story.

#### Analogy:
Imagine having a single house with multiple rooms, each designed for different purposes (e.g., bedroom, kitchen, living room). Each room can function independently while sharing the same building and resources, like water and electricity. In the same way, operating system level virtualization allows multiple isolated environments to run on one physical machine, sharing the same OS kernel and other resources.

### Interactive Activities for Operating System Level Virtualisation
 1. **Debate Topic**: "Operating System Level Virtualisation provides efficient use of resources by sharing the same OS kernel among different environments, but its limitation to running only one type of operating system per host may hinder versatility and flexibility. Should we prioritise efficiency over diversity in our virtualised environments?"

2. **What If' Scenario Question**: "Imagine a scenario where a company is looking to adopt Operating System Level Virtualisation for their data centre. They currently have applications running on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. What if the chosen OS for the host is only capable of running Linux? How would this decision impact the efficiency and functionality of their operations, and what compromises would they need to make?"

## Teaching Module: Para-virtualisation
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a faraway virtual world, there was a kingdom called Softwareland. In this realm, many different software applications lived and thrived, each with its own unique requirements for the hardware on which they ran. One day, the ruler of the land, King Computer, realized that his subjects were not using their full potential due to certain limitations.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
As the king sought a solution, a wise sorceress named Paravirtualization appeared before him. She explained that she had discovered a magical power known as "Para-virtualisation," which could help improve the performance and efficiency of her subjects. In this new realm, the software applications would be modified to interact with a special helper called a hypervisor through specific interfaces or "hooks." This hypervisor, being a Type1 Hypervisor, would run directly on the hardware, making it faster than its full virtualization counterparts.

The king was intrigued by this idea and asked how it worked. The sorceress explained that the guest operating system would be altered to use these "hooks," allowing direct communication with the hypervisor. This communication bypassed some of the emulation layers required in full virtualization, reducing overhead and improving performance significantly.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The king was delighted to learn about the strengths of Para-virtualisation. He knew that improved performance could revolutionize his kingdom, but he also understood that there were trade-offs involved. The sorceress warned him that modifying the guest operating system could limit compatibility with some applications. Nevertheless, the king believed that the benefits of enhanced performance and efficiency outweighed these potential drawbacks.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in improving the efficiency of their virtualized environment.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
#### Pacing
Pause after introducing the problem to allow students to empathize with King Computer's situation. Pause again after explaining Para-virtualisation for students to grasp the concept fully. Ask questions during the story to engage students and encourage them to think critically about the issue at hand.

#### Analogy
Imagine you're hosting a party, but everyone has to use walkie-talkies to communicate. In full virtualization, each person uses a different walkie-talkie brand with unique features, making communication slow and difficult. With Para-virtualisation, everyone switches to the same brand of walkie-talkies, allowing them to talk more efficiently and understand one another better.

### Interactive Activities for Para-virtualisation
 1. Debate Topic: "Para-virtualisation provides better performance than full virtualization by reducing overhead; however, its requirement for modification of the guest operating system can limit compatibility. Does this trade-off make para-virtualisation a preferable choice in certain situations, or is the compatibility issue too significant to outweigh the performance benefits?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine you are responsible for setting up a virtualized environment for a company that requires high-performance computing and is willing to make some adjustments to their guest operating system. Would you choose para-virtualization or full virtualization, and why? Consider the trade-offs between improved performance and compatibility when justifying your choice."

## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event):
Once upon a time in a bustling city, there was a busy data center that hosted numerous operating systems on various hardware configurations. Each of these systems had to be carefully managed and maintained, causing a significant amount of stress for the administrators. They wished they could run all their different operating systems on the same machine without needing to modify any of them.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):
One day, a brilliant engineer named Emma stumbled upon the concept of "Full Virtualization." She discovered that this technique could simulate complete hardware environments for each guest OS, and it didn't require modification of the guest operating system. This meant that she could run any operating system without needing to be aware of the hypervisor underneath. The underlying device was effectively turned into a virtual machine!

#### The Impact (Meaning):
The concept of Full Virtualization became Emma's secret weapon in managing the data center efficiently. It provided a high degree of flexibility and compatibility, allowing different operating systems to run on the same physical hardware without modifications. This significantly reduced the stress levels of the administrators and saved the company both time and money. However, Emma also knew that there was a trade-off: Full Virtualization had a higher performance overhead due to the complete hardware simulation. But with its strengths far outweighing its weaknesses, she embraced the concept wholeheartedly and continued to improve the data center's operations.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question:
What if you could run any operating system on the same machine without having to modify it? How would that change the way we manage our computer systems?

#### Point of View:
From the perspective of an overworked data center administrator struggling to manage a diverse array of operating systems.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
#### Pacing:
- After introducing the problem, pause for a moment and ask students if they have ever encountered similar challenges in their own experiences.
- When explaining the 'Aha!' Moment, slow down when discussing how Full Virtualization works to allow students to fully grasp the concept.
- As you discuss the impact of Full Virtualization, pause and ask open-ended questions to encourage student participation and discussion.

#### Analogy:
Imagine a restaurant where each table is equipped with a different set of utensils and plates. Instead of having to replace or modify these items for each customer, the restaurant manager uses a magic box that can transform any utensil and plate into any other type on-demand. This way, all customers can use their preferred dining setup without any changes to the existing equipment.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
 1. **Debate Topic**: "Full virtualisation, despite its higher performance overhead due to complete hardware simulation, provides significant benefits in terms of high compatibility with various guest operating systems. Should we prioritise this compatibility over performance efficiency when selecting a virtualisation strategy for our organisation?"

2. **What If' Scenario Question**: "Imagine a scenario where a company is choosing between full virtualisation and para-virtualisation for their cloud computing infrastructure. The full virtualisation approach offers high compatibility with various guest operating systems, but comes at the cost of higher performance overhead due to complete hardware simulation. On the other hand, para-virtualisation has lower performance overhead, but may have compatibility issues with certain guest operating systems. Given these trade-offs, which approach would you recommend and why?"

## Teaching Module: Hypervisor Types
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
Once upon a time in a bustling city filled with high-tech skyscrapers, there was an engineer named Emma who worked at a top-notch tech company. Her job was to manage and optimize the company's computer systems, but she was facing a huge challenge: she had to run multiple software applications on one single server without any of them interfering with each other.

**The Problem (Event)**: Emma was struggling to ensure that all the different software programs could work together seamlessly and efficiently without affecting each other's performance. She knew that if she didn't find a solution soon, her company would suffer significant losses in productivity and potential business opportunities.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: One day, while researching for solutions to her problem, Emma stumbled upon the concept of hypervisors - software that creates and runs virtual machines by separating the physical hardware from the operating system instances. She learned that there were two types of hypervisors: Type1 hypervisors run directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and manage guest operating systems, while Type2 hypervisors, or hosted hypervisors, run on a conventional operating system just like other computer programs.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Emma realized that understanding hypervisor types was essential for evaluating performance trade-offs in virtualization environments. She understood from the `Significance_Detail` that Type1 hypervisors generally offer better performance due to direct hardware access, which meant they would be perfect for her company's needs. However, she also knew from the `Weaknesses` section that hosted hypervisors (Type2) had higher overhead due to additional software layers, making them less efficient in her situation.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
- **Dramatic Question**: "Can a single computer run multiple operating systems without affecting each other's performance?"
- **Point of View**: From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in managing and optimizing server resources.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- **Pacing**: Begin with the dramatic question, then introduce Emma's problem and the 'Aha!' moment. Finally, discuss the impact and significance of hypervisor types, pausing to ask questions about each point to keep students engaged.
- **Analogy**: Imagine a busy restaurant where all the chefs (software applications) must work together in harmony, but they can't interfere with each other's cooking process. The hypervisors are like the head chef who manages and directs the activities of all the individual chefs to ensure everything runs smoothly and efficiently.

### Interactive Activities for Hypervisor Types
 1. Debate Topic: "Type 1 Hypervisors, despite their superior performance and efficiency, are not as widely adopted as Type 2 Hypervisors due to their higher cost and complexity. This suggests that the benefits of running directly on the hardware may not outweigh the additional overhead associated with Type 1 Hypervisors in most cases. Discuss."

2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine you are tasked with setting up a cloud computing platform for a large corporation with high-security requirements. The company's management wants to minimize the risk of any security breaches at all costs, but they also want to maximize the performance and efficiency of their operations. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of Type 1 and Type 2 Hypervisors, which type would you recommend and why?"
