## Teaching Module: Master Components
 ### 1. The Story
**The Problem (Event)**: In the world of containerized applications, there was once a company facing significant challenges in managing their growing fleet of containers. They struggled to ensure that resources were efficiently utilized and that their applications remained reliable across their sprawling infrastructure.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: One day, they discovered Kubernetes, an open-source platform designed to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. At the heart of this powerful system lay the Master Components. These components controlled the scheduling, scaling, and health management of containers within the cluster. The API server acted as the central control point for all interactions with Kubernetes, while the Scheduler decided where to place new containers based on available resources and requirements. Finally, the Controller Manager ensured that the desired state of the cluster was maintained at all times.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: With these Master Components in place, the company could effectively orchestrate their container operations across the entire Kubernetes cluster. This centralized control allowed them to maintain consistent management and decision-making processes, leading to more efficient resource utilization and increased application reliability. Despite its importance, it's worth noting that over-reliance on a single point of control could potentially lead to vulnerabilities if not managed carefully.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
**Dramatic Question**: What if you could manage your entire containerized infrastructure with just one set of components?

**Point of View**: From the perspective of an engineer tasked with managing a complex, multi-container environment.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
