## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in the land of Cloudia, there was a great division between two groups - the users and the cloud service providers. They both had their own responsibilities when it came to security, but no one could clearly define where one ended and the other began. This led to misunderstandings and oversights in ensuring the safety of the cloud environment, causing chaos and confusion.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a wise council of experts from both groups came together and discovered the Shared Responsibility Model. They realized that the security obligations could be divided among three levels: infrastructure providers, service providers, and the user. This model clearly delineated the roles of everyone involved in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS offerings.

In this new world order, the users knew exactly what they were responsible for, while the providers also had a clear understanding of their security tasks. They all worked together to create a secure cloud environment where each level met its specific security requirements.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The Shared Responsibility Model was a game-changer in Cloudia. It provided clear guidelines on the division of security tasks, helping both providers and customers understand their roles. This not only reduced ambiguity but also enhanced the overall security posture.
