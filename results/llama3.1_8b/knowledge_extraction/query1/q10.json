      "Concept": "Kubernetes",
      "Definition": "An open source container orchestration tool originally developed by Google engineers.",
      "Key_Points": [
        "Kubernetes allows you to build application services that span multiple containers, schedule containers across a cluster, scale those containers, and manage their health over time.",
        "It eliminates many manual processes involved in deploying and scaling applications.",
        "Kubernetes is ideal for hosting Cloud-native apps that require rapid scaling."

      "Key_Points": [
        "Pods are the basic execution unit in Kubernetes.",
        "They can contain multiple containers that work together to provide a service.",
        "Pods are ephemeral, meaning they can be created, scaled, and deleted as needed."
