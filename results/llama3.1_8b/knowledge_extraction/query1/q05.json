    {
      "Concept": "Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)",

        "SOA is an evolution of the Client/Server architecture.",
        "It introduces a new component to help locate services.",
        "Services in SOA are stateless, making design scalable."

      "Significance_Detail": "The importance of SOA lies in its ability to make system design more scalable and flexible by introducing statelessness and abstraction through interfaces. This allows for easier maintenance and modification of systems as they grow in complexity.",

        "SOA enables scalability by making services stateless, allowing for easier maintenance and modification of systems."

      "Weaknesses": [
        "Implementing SOA can be complex due to the need for standardization of communication between client and server and hiding implementation details from clients."

        "This allows for easier modification and maintenance of systems."

        "They standardize communication between client and server."
