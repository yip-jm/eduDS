However, there was a weakness: IAM required proper configuration and maintenance for effective security.

## 2. Storytelling Hooks
### Dramatic Question
What if the key to a more secure cloud computing system lay in making it smarter by focusing on managing digital identities?

### Point of View
Consider this story from the perspective of an engineer facing the challenge of securing their company's cloud resources.

## 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
### Pacing
- When introducing IAM, pause after mentioning "cloud providers offer identity management services like AWS IAM."
- Ask the students, "Can you name some other cloud providers that offer similar services?" This will keep them engaged and thinking.

### Analogy
Imagine a fortress with multiple gates. Each gate represents a digital resource in the cloud. The guards at each gate are the digital identities managed by IAM. By ensuring only authorized guards can access the gates, IAM helps protect the entire fortress (the cloud resources).

### Interactive Activities for Identity/Access Management
 1. Debate Topic: "While Identity/Access Management (IAM) is crucial for preventing unauthorized access and securing data ownership, its effectiveness largely depends on proper configuration and maintenance. Should companies invest more resources in ensuring these aspects to maximize security benefits, or would it be more efficient to prioritize other cybersecurity measures?"

2. What If Scenario Question: "In a world where IAM is optional, imagine you are the CEO of a large corporation with valuable customer data. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of Identity/Access Management, would you choose to implement an IAM system for your company, or rely on other security measures? Justify your choice based on the potential trade-offs."
