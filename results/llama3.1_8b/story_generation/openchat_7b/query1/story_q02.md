## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)
#### The Problem (Event)
Once upon a time in a bustling data center, there were numerous virtual machines working tirelessly to provide services to users all around the world. However, these machines were struggling with performance issues and were not making optimal use of their resources.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, an ingenious engineer discovered a new technique called Para-Virtualisation. In this technique, the guest operating system was modified to use a set of hooks that improved machine execution simulation. This was made possible by a Type1 Hypervisor which enabled the modification of the guest operating system and allowed it to communicate more efficiently with the host system.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
This new method brought about significant improvements in performance and efficiency within the virtualized environments. However, it came at a cost - the modification of the guest operating system was a complex and time-consuming process. Despite this drawback, Para-Virtualisation's strengths far outweighed its weaknesses, as it allowed for better resource utilization and improved overall performance in virtualized systems.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
#### Dramatic Question
Can modifying the guest operating system actually make a computer run faster and more efficiently?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer facing the challenge of optimizing performance and resource utilization in a virtualized environment.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips
#### Pacing
Pause after introducing the problem to allow students to reflect on their own experiences with performance issues in virtual environments. Pause again after discussing the discovery of Para-Virtualisation to let them absorb the information before moving on to its impact.

#### Analogy
Imagine a busy restaurant where all the waiters and waitresses are wearing heavy costumes that slow them down. The restaurant owner discovers that if he modifies their outfits slightly, they can move faster and serve more customers efficiently. This is similar to what Para-Virtualisation does for virtual machines - it makes them run more efficiently by making a few modifications.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
 1. Debate Topic: "Para-Virtualisation improves performance and efficiency in virtualized environments; however, the requirement of modifying the guest operating system can be time-consuming and complex. Should organizations adopt Para-Virtualisation despite its complexities to gain efficiency or should they rather stick to traditional virtualization methods due to ease of implementation?"
   
2. What If Scenario Question: "Imagine a company is considering adopting Para-Virtualisation for their IT infrastructure. They have two options: Option A - Adopt Para-Virtualisation and modify the guest operating system, or Option B - Stick with traditional virtualization methods. In this scenario, if they choose Option A, explain how the improvement in performance and better resource utilization can outweigh the complexity of modifying the guest operating system. If they choose Option B, justify why sticking to traditional virtualization methods is a better choice despite not having the benefits of Para-Virtualisation."

## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
 ### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event):
Once upon a time in a faraway land called ComputerWorld, there was a kingdom known as OperatingSystemia. In this realm, there lived many diverse and powerful creatures, each with unique abilities to control the resources of their habitat: the computer hardware. However, in recent times, the peace and harmony among these beings were disrupted by a mysterious entity called Viruslandia.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):
One day, a wise sage named Full Virtualisation appeared in OperatingSystemia. He had heard of the troubles and decided to help. He explained that he could create an entirely new world within the computer, completely separate from the physical resources outside. This new world would be self-contained and secure, and each creature could live there happily without fear of Viruslandia entering their home.

To achieve this, Full Virtualisation would fully simulate all the hardware of the underlying device, providing a virtual machine for each guest operating system. This way, the creatures would not interact directly with the real resources but rather with the layers of software created by the wise sage himself.

#### The Impact (Meaning):
Although this new world provided safety and isolation from Viruslandia, it came at a cost. Full Virtualisation's magic was complex and required more work for his fellow magical beings, known as the VMM. They had to go through many layers of software to provide the service, resulting in higher inherent virtualization costs. However, the people of OperatingSystemia knew that this sacrifice was worth it for the protection and peace that Full Virtualisation's magic brought.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question:
What if we could create a perfect, isolated world within a computer where nothing from outside could harm its inhabitants?

#### Point of View:
From the perspective of a wise sage named Full Virtualisation, who has come to help the people of OperatingSystemia.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing:
- Introduce the problem of Viruslandia and the challenges faced by the creatures in OperatingSystemia.
- Describe the arrival of Full Virtualisation, focusing on his solution to the problem.
- Explain the impact and trade-offs of Full Virtualisation's magic.
- Pause after each major point to allow students time for understanding and questions.

#### Analogy:
Think of a computer as a vast kingdom with many cities (hardware) and inhabitants (operating systems). Full Virtualisation creates a separate, self-contained city within the kingdom that is immune to external threats (Viruslandia), but this new city requires more effort to maintain and has higher costs.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
 1. **Debate Topic**: "Full Virtualisation provides a complete and self-contained virtual environment with better isolation and security, but is it worth the higher inherent cost due to the need for the VMM to go through more layers of software?"

2. **What If' Scenario Question**: "Imagine you are in charge of setting up a new server infrastructure for a major government institution. Would you choose Full Virtualisation or Paravirtualisation, considering that Full Virtualisation provides a complete and self-contained virtual environment with better isolation and security but has higher inherent cost, while Paravirtualisation has lower cost but requires more direct interaction between the host and guest operating systems?"

Once upon a time, there was a large corporation that had grown exponentially over the years. They had numerous departments and thousands of employees working from different locations. As their business grew, so did their need for efficient use of technology. The IT department was tasked with managing a virtualized environment to support all these users and applications. But they soon found themselves facing slow performance and limited resources in their virtualized environment.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): The IT department discovered Hardware-Supported Virtualization, which improved the efficiency of their virtualized environment by reducing the complexity of virtualization and leveraging hardware-assisted features.

One day, the IT department heard about a new concept called "Hardware-Supported Virtualisation." They learned that this technique uses hardware-assisted virtualization to improve performance and efficiency in virtualized environments. It also has lower inherent virtualization cost compared to full virtualization.

### The Impact (Meaning): Hardware-Supported Virtualization was a game-changer for the corporation, as it significantly improved performance and efficiency while reducing the complexity of virtualization. However, it required hardware support for virtualization, which meant that not all devices could utilize this technology.

By implementing Hardware-Supported Virtualisation, the IT department was able to significantly improve the performance and efficiency of their virtualized environment. This allowed them to better serve their users and applications with fewer resources. The corporation realized the importance of this concept and began to invest in hardware that supported virtualization.
