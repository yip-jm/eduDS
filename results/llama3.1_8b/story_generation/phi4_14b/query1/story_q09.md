## Teaching Module: Pods
## 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

**The Problem (Event):**

Once upon a time in the bustling city of DevTown, developers faced a great challenge: managing their growing number of containers efficiently. Each container was like an individual worker with unique skills, but coordinating them to work together smoothly required constant attention and effort. This complexity often led to inefficiencies, as resources were not optimally utilized, and developers had to focus more on infrastructure details than the actual application logic they wanted to create.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience):**

One day, a wise engineer named Alex stumbled upon an ancient scroll that spoke of "Pods" — magical containers that could be grouped together. According to the scroll, a Pod was a group of one or more containers that shared resources and were managed as a single unit. Fascinated by this discovery, Alex realized that these Pods could always be scheduled together on the same node, meaning they would work in perfect harmony without any delay.

Moreover, Pods provided an elegant way to manage related containers as a cohesive entity. This meant that developers like Alex could now implement load balancing and high availability with ease, ensuring their applications were both robust and efficient. The idea of Pods was revolutionary: by grouping related containers together, they allowed for seamless coordination and resource sharing among them.
