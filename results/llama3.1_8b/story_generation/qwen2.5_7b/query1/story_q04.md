## Teaching Module: Docker
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine you're a software developer working on a project that involves multiple programming languages and frameworks. You've built your application on your local machine, but when you try to deploy it on a different system, strange things happen: some features don't work as expected, environment variables are missing, or dependencies are not correctly set up. This inconsistency leads to frustration and delays in development cycles.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while browsing the internet for solutions to this problem, you stumble upon Docker. You read about its capabilities: it allows developers to package their applications along with all of their dependencies into lightweight containers that can run on any machine. Excited by the potential, you decide to give it a try. You learn that Docker provides operating system-level virtualization for applications, meaning your application shares the same kernel as the host OS but runs in isolation from other processes. This means that whether you're working on Linux or Windows, your containerized application will always run consistently.

Docker images are also lightweight and easy to share between systems. You can create a Dockerfile that defines how to build an image with all necessary dependencies and configurations. Once the image is built, it can be shared with others who can then use the same instructions to reproduce the exact environment in which your application was developed.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
This discovery couldn't come at a better time! With Docker, you can now package your applications in a consistent manner that makes deployment and management across different environments seamless. This leads to faster development cycles and improved collaboration among teams because everyone can work with the same environment. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows—Docker does require significant system resources, which can impact performance in large-scale deployments.

### Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter by ensuring applications run consistently across different environments?

## Teaching Module: Singularity
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine you are working on a complex scientific project that requires advanced computational resources. Your team has developed an intricate simulation model that runs flawlessly on your local machine. However, when it comes time to share this model with other researchers or deploy it in a different High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment, things get complicated. Each system has its own configuration, and dependencies can vary wildly. This inconsistency leads to errors, delays, and frustration as team members struggle to make the simulation work on each new machine.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while browsing through a collection of open-source tools designed for HPC environments, you come across Singularity. Initially, it seems like another containerization platform—just one more tool in your toolkit. However, as you delve deeper into its capabilities, you realize that Singularity is something special. It allows you to package not only the application but also all of its dependencies and even access to underlying hardware resources—all within a single, portable environment.

Singularity works by creating a container—a self-contained software package—that includes everything an application needs to run, including libraries, environment variables, and even the ability to interact with the host system's hardware. This means that regardless of where you deploy your Singularity container—whether it’s on your laptop, a remote server, or another researcher’s workstation—it will behave exactly as expected.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The impact of using Singularity is profound. It addresses one of the biggest challenges in HPC environments: ensuring consistency and reliability across different systems.
