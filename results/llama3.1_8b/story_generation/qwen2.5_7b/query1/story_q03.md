## Teaching Module: Docker
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine you're a software developer working on an exciting new application. Your task is straightforward: create and deploy this app as quickly and efficiently as possible. But here’s where things get tricky. You have to consider not just the code, but also the environment in which it will run—operating systems, libraries, dependencies, and more. Every time you switch from your development machine to a production server or another developer's laptop, you might encounter issues because these environments can vary significantly. This inconsistency makes deploying applications a tedious and error-prone process.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, during a conference, you stumble upon Docker—a containerization platform that promises to solve your problems. You learn that Docker allows developers to package their applications along with all the necessary dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Each container runs as an isolated process on the host machine and shares its kernel with it. This means that regardless of where the application is deployed, from a developer's laptop to a cloud server, everything remains consistent.

In this approach, Docker uses layers to create images (like building blocks) which are then used to generate containers (live applications). These containers can be started, stopped, and managed independently, making deployment and scaling incredibly fast. The key is that the containerized application doesn’t depend on specific configurations or settings of the host machine; it’s all about the layers and dependencies within the container.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
This discovery is revolutionary because it allows developers to focus entirely on writing code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. With Docker, you can quickly deploy applications in a consistent environment, ensuring that bugs related to configuration issues are minimized. Moreover, since containers are lightweight and share the host’s kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines, making them ideal for scaling up or down based on demand.

However, there are trade-offs. While Docker significantly improves development efficiency and consistency, it may not be as suitable for older systems that don’t support containerization well. Additionally, if not properly configured, security concerns can arise due to the isolated nature of containers. Despite these limitations, Docker’s strengths—fast deployment, lightweight nature, and portability—make it a game-changer in application development.

### Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

#### Point of View

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine you are an engineer in charge of managing servers at a high-performance computing center. Your task is to run multiple applications efficiently on a single powerful server to maximize resource utilization and minimize costs. However, running these applications as traditional virtual machines (VMs) presents several challenges: each VM requires its own kernel and system resources, leading to higher overhead and slower performance. Additionally, you need to ensure that the applications are isolated from each other to prevent any unintended interactions or data leaks.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while browsing through new technologies in your field, you come across a solution called Linux Containers (LXC). LXC is a lightweight virtualization technology that allows multiple isolated Linux systems to run on a single host. This technology uses the Linux kernel's built-in container features to create and manage these containers. Each container shares the same kernel as the host system but has its own file system, network stack, and process space, providing high isolation between applications.

LXC works by creating a set of namespaces for each application or service. Namespaces ensure that processes inside a container can only see what is within their namespace, effectively isolating them from other containers on the same host. This approach eliminates the need for multiple kernels, significantly reducing overhead and improving performance compared to traditional VMs.

LXC also supports a wide range of file systems and networking protocols, making it highly versatile. You realize that LXC can be the solution you've been looking for—it provides lightweight isolation and efficient resource management, allowing you to run many applications on a single powerful server without compromising on performance or security.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
LXC is important because it offers a lightweight and efficient way to run multiple isolated Linux systems on a single host. This technology enables easy management and deployment of applications in HPC environments by providing high isolation between containers, which is crucial for preventing any potential conflicts or vulnerabilities. However, it also comes with trade-offs: LXC primarily supports Linux-based systems, limiting its use in mixed operating system environments. Furthermore, if not properly configured, security concerns can arise due to the shared kernel.

### Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter? In this case, by reducing some of the overhead associated with traditional virtualization, LXC can help you run more applications efficiently and effectively!

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge in managing multiple applications on a single powerful server, how does LXC provide a solution that balances efficiency, isolation, and resource management?

### Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**: Start by setting up the problem scenario, then introduce the discovery and solution. Pause to allow students to reflect on why this might be a useful tool.
  
  - *Pause Point 1*: After explaining the challenges with traditional VMs, ask: "Can you think of any ways to reduce these overheads while still ensuring isolation between applications?"

- **Analogy**: Use the analogy of a library. Just as each section of a library has its own books and rules (analogous to containers), LXC allows different sections of an application to operate independently, but all sharing the same main building (the host kernel).

  - *Pause Point 2*: After introducing namespaces in LXC, ask: "How is this like having separate sections in a library? What are the benefits and limitations?"

- **Summary**: Recap the key points by summarizing how LXC solves problems related to traditional VMs and highlights its strengths while discussing potential weaknesses.

  - *Pause Point 3*: Conclude with: "So, what do you think makes LXC an important tool in managing applications on a single powerful server?"
