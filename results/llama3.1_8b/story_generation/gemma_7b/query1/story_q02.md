## Teaching Module: Operating System Level Virtualisation
## 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the bustling tech industry, companies juggle numerous projects, each demanding dedicated resources. Physical servers were becoming costly and inefficient, limiting flexibility and scalability.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Operating System Level Virtualisation! This innovative technology uses isolation mechanisms like memory management and process isolation to create virtual environments for users, similar to dedicated servers. It allows multiple virtual environments to coexist on a single physical host.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: This game-changer improves resource utilization by packing more workloads onto a single server. It also boosts flexibility by offering users independent control over their virtual environments, akin to having their own dedicated server. While sacrificing some performance due to isolation, Operating System Level Virtualisation delivers significant cost savings and scalability, making it a vital tool for modern computing.


## 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: "Can we give computers multiple personalities without giving them a split personality?"
* **Point of View**: "Imagine being a system administrator tasked with managing multiple projects on a single server - how can you ensure each project has its dedicated space without breaking the bank?"


## 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Introduce the concept gradually, building from the need for resource efficiency to the solution of virtualisation. Pause at the 'Aha!' moment to allow students to grasp the concept.
* **Analogy**: Compare the process of virtualisation to renting out rooms in a large house. Each tenant (virtual environment) gets their own space (virtual machine) with dedicated resources, while sharing common spaces (physical hardware).

### Interactive Activities for Operating System Level Virtualisation
## Debate Topic:

**Is operating system level virtualization a viable solution for improving resource utilization in modern computing environments, despite potential performance trade-offs?**

## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine you are tasked with deploying a new application that requires high performance. Would you prioritize using operating system level virtualization for resource utilization or prioritize raw hardware resources for better performance? Explain your reasoning based on the strengths and weaknesses of this technology.**

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
## Storytelling Module: Para-Virtualisation

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

**The Problem (Event)**: In the bustling world of virtual machines, performance often bottlenecks. Virtual machines can feel like sluggish turtles, hindering productivity.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Para-Virtualisation! This innovative technique lets virtual machines tap into the hypervisor's inner workings. By strategically modifying the guest operating system, it installs special hooks – like secret hand signals between friends – allowing the hypervisor to optimize machine execution.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: This remarkable transformation empowers virtual machines to dance like graceful gazelles. Resource utilization shoots up, and overall performance becomes a smooth, streamlined experience. But remember, this magic comes at a cost. Para-Virtualisation requires intricate surgery on the guest OS, demanding careful attention from seasoned engineers.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question**: Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?
* **Point of View**: Let's explore this phenomenon through the eyes of a virtual machine yearning for speed and efficiency.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing**: Pause after describing the performance bottleneck to engage students in discussing the problem. Ask open-ended questions like "What challenges might arise when virtualizing a system?" before introducing Para-Virtualisation.
* **Analogy**: Imagine a classroom filled with students. Traditional virtualization is like asking them to share a single notebook for all their notes. Para-Virtualisation is like providing each student with their own notebook and encouraging them to take notes more efficiently.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
## Debate Topic:

**Is para-virtualisation a worthwhile technology for virtualized environments despite the need for guest OS modification?**


## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a scenario where you are tasked with optimizing the performance of a virtualized application running in a production environment. You have the option to implement para-virtualization or explore alternative resource management techniques. Which approach would you choose and why? Consider the potential trade-offs involved.**

## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
## Storytelling Module: Full Virtualisation

### 1. The Story

**The Problem (Event)**: In the realm of computing, engineers often grapple with the need for secure and isolated environments to test software and applications. Traditional approaches involved physical hardware, which was expensive and cumbersome to manage.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: Enter Full Virtualisation. This revolutionary technique allows engineers to completely simulate all the hardware components of a physical device within a software-based virtual machine. By isolating the guest operating system from the underlying hardware, Full Virtualisation offers enhanced security and control.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: While providing a complete and self-contained virtual environment, Full Virtualisation comes with its own performance considerations. The process of virtualizing every hardware component adds layers of software, leading to slightly reduced performance compared to native execution. However, for the enhanced security and isolation it offers, this trade-off is often deemed worthwhile.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**: Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

**Point of View**: Imagine being an engineer tasked with building a secure and flexible testing environment for cutting-edge software.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing**: Introduce the concept slowly, building up the need for secure virtual environments. Pause after the 'Aha!' moment to allow students to grasp the significance of Full Virtualisation.

**Analogy**: Think of Full Virtualisation as creating a digital sandbox for your computer. Just as a sandbox allows you to experiment without harming the surrounding environment, Full Virtualisation provides a secure space to test and refine software without affecting the underlying system.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
## Debate Topic:

**Is the increased isolation and security provided by full virtualization worth the additional virtualization cost?**

## What If Scenario Question:

**Imagine a future where virtualisation technology significantly reduces the cost associated with full virtualization. How might this change the considerations and trade-offs associated with this technology?**
