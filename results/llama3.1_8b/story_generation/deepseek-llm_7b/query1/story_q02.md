## Teaching Module: Operating System Level Virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

---

In the world of technology, companies and individuals often found themselves in need of computing resources that could handle their diverse workloads. These tasks varied from running complex software applications to hosting websites or managing databases. However, there was a problem - these heavy-duty applications needed more powerful hardware than what was available. 

The solution came in the form of Operating System Level Virtualisation (OSLV). OSLV is an innovative technology that allows multiple virtual environments to run on a single physical host, thereby improving resource utilization and enhancing flexibility. By using isolation mechanisms for virtualization, users can now have virtual environments similar to dedicated servers without having to invest heavily in hardware or infrastructure.

The impact of this concept has been immense - it transformed the way we think about server management and computing resources allocation. It allowed businesses to utilize their limited resources efficiently by sharing them between multiple applications and services while maintaining high performance levels. This, in turn, led to reduced costs for data centers as they no longer needed large amounts of physical servers to handle various workloads.

2. Storytelling Hooks

---

"Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?" OSLV takes the concept of virtualisation and pushes it further by operating at an operating system level, providing users with more isolated environments while still utilizing shared hardware resources effectively. 

From the perspective of an engineer facing a challenge to manage diverse workloads on limited computing resources, understanding Operating System Level Virtualization can prove invaluable in optimizing their infrastructure's efficiency. This knowledge will allow them to make better decisions about where and when they need dedicated servers versus sharing resources with other applications or services.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips

---

When discussing OSLV, it is essential to keep the pace of your explanation steady but not rushed. You can use analogies such as "imagine if you had several different toy kitchens in a single room - each one could have its oven and stove without any interference from the others!" This will help students visualize how multiple virtual environments can coexist on a single physical host, thus improving resource utilization.

Additionally, encourage your students to ask questions about OSLV, such as "how does it work?" or "what are some of the benefits compared to traditional server management methods?". By engaging them in discussions and answering their queries, you will help make this concept more relatable and meaningful for your audience.

### Interactive Activities for Operating System Level Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Is operating system level virtualisation more beneficial than detrimental for resource utilization?"

Statement: Operating system level virtualisation allows multiple virtual environments to run on a single physical host, improving resource utilisation by allowing users to share resources efficiently. However, it may have performance trade-offs due to the need for isolation mechanisms, leading to potential inefficiencies and decreased overall performance of the machine. This debate will explore whether the advantages provided by operating system level virtualisation outweigh its drawbacks in terms of resource utilization.

2. What If Scenario Question: "Consider a large multinational company with multiple branches around the world that requires a secure environment for their sensitive data sharing and storage, while maintaining flexibility and ease-of-use. Would you recommend an operating system level virtualisation solution as the primary method to meet these needs?" 

Answer: This scenario forces students to consider both the strengths (enhancements in flexibility and security) and weaknesses (potential performance trade-offs) of using an operating system level virtualisation solution for data sharing and storage. Students will need to weigh whether the advantages provided by increased security, ease of use, and flexible environment outweigh the potential drawbacks in terms of overall machine performance before coming to a conclusion.

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem → Solution → Impact)

Imagine you're an engineer working on optimizing a computer system. You notice that your virtualized machines are struggling to run efficiently due to resource conflicts and wasted resources. These inefficient operations lead to longer processing times, which in turn slow down the entire operation.

One day, during one of those late-night brainstorming sessions with colleagues, you stumble upon an innovative solution: Para-Virtualisation! This concept allows for better performance and efficiency by using hooks within the guest operating system - meaning it doesn't require any modification to your virtual machines, unlike its counterpart, Full Virtualization.

With this newfound knowledge, you quickly implement this technique in your virtualized environments. The impact is striking: resources are now utilized more efficiently; there's less waste and better performance across the board. This leads to a smoother operation overall, making everyone's job easier!

2. Storytelling Hooks

- Dramatic Question: "Can you make a computer smarter by turning it into an idiot?" (This question piques interest in understanding Para-Virtualisation)

- Point of View: "From the perspective of a systems engineer who wants to optimize performance without breaking the bank." 

3. Classroom Delivery Tips

* Pacing: When discussing this concept, pause briefly at each key point for students to absorb and process information before moving on. Encourage discussion during these pauses to ensure they grasp the idea thoroughly.

* Analogy: Imagine a chef trying to cook multiple dishes in an overcrowded kitchen. While cooking, some ingredients get wasted or spill onto other dishes due to lack of space. Introducing a new system (Para-Virtualisation) gives the chef more room and tools to manage resources effectively without wasting any ingredients - allowing for better overall efficiency.

### Interactive Activities for Para-Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Should we prioritize performance over simplicity when adopting para-virtualization in virtualized environments?"

In this debate topic, one team would argue for prioritizing performance (stronger) over simplifying the guest operating system modification process (weaker), while the other team would advocate for a more simplified approach to ensure easy adoption of the technology. The discussion could involve discussing trade-offs between improved efficiency and ease of implementation, as well as how these factors impact overall system stability and security in different types of virtualized environments.

2. 'What If' Scenario Question: "If para-virtualization was implemented without considering resource utilization, what possible consequences might we face?"

In this scenario question, students would have to consider the potential trade-offs between improved performance and better resource utilization when adopting para-virtualization. They could discuss how a poorly optimized implementation of para-virtualization could lead to reduced system efficiency, increased energy consumption, or even security vulnerabilities due to improper allocation of resources. The discussion could encourage critical thinking about balancing technological advancements with practical considerations in virtualized environments.

## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
1. The Story (Problem → Solution → Impact)

---

The Problem (Event): Imagine you're an IT manager overseeing several physical computers in your company's data center. You want to run different operating systems and applications simultaneously without overloading them, but the hardware isn't powerful enough or cost-effective for virtualization. There is a need for more efficient resource utilization and isolation between processes running on these machines.

The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience): Full Virtualization, as its name suggests, fully simulates all the hardware of an underlying device by providing a virtual machine to the guest operating system. Essentially, it creates a self-contained environment where each virtual machine operates independently without any direct access or communication with other machines in the data center. This allows you to run multiple isolated environments on one physical server!

The Impact (Meaning): With full virtualization, you can now efficiently allocate resources across various workloads and applications, providing better performance, improved efficiency, increased security, and reduced costs by eliminating redundant hardware purchases. However, there are some trade-offs – due to the inherent complexity of fully virtualizing all the underlying device's hardware components, it may lead to slightly higher virtualization cost in terms of both resource utilization and potential performance loss compared to other forms of virtualization such as paravirtualization or partial virtualization.

2. Storytelling Hooks:

- Dramatic Question: "Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?"
    - Point of View: "From the perspective of an IT professional striving for more efficient resource utilization and improved security."

3. Classroom Delivery Tips:

When discussing full virtualization with your students, try to convey its importance by emphasizing how it allows better isolation between processes running on a single server, leading to enhanced performance and cost savings in managing hardware resources. To make the concept relatable for them, use an analogy such as "Imagine if you could run multiple computer games simultaneously on one gaming console without any conflict or interference among them."

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
1. Debate Topic: "Is full virtualization beneficial for improving system security despite it having higher costs?"

Statement: Full Virtualization can provide a complete and self-contained virtual environment leading to better isolation and security, while also having the inherent virtualization cost due to the need for VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor) to go through many more layers of software. However, is this benefit in terms of improved system security worth the extra costs involved?

2. What If Scenario: "In a company's IT department, they have decided to implement full virtualization for their server infrastructure. The CIO has been asked by the board members if there are any potential drawbacks and how these could be mitigated."

Scenario Question: Considering both the cost implications of implementing full virtualization and the additional security advantages it provides, what are some strategies that the IT department can employ to balance out the trade-offs while ensuring system stability?
