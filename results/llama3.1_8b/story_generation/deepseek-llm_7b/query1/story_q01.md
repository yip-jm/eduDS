## Teaching Module: Hypervisors
1. The Story (Problem - Solution - Impact)
-------------------------

In the early days of computer architecture, physical hardware resources were shared among multiple users and applications, resulting in low utilization rates and high costs. This led to a need for better resource management solutions that would allow more efficient use of these valuable assets. 

One day, while working on a complex project involving multiple virtual machines running simultaneously, John had an 'Aha!' moment when he discovered hypervisors - software that could create and manage virtual machines by providing a layer of abstraction between the physical hardware and the operating system. He was amazed at how this simple concept could solve his resource management challenge!

With hypervisors in place, John's team found that they could now run multiple virtual machines on a single physical host, significantly improving their resource utilization rates. This made it easier for them to manage and maintain their servers, leading to significant cost savings while also increasing the flexibility of their system.

2. Storytelling Hooks
--------------------
- Dramatic Question: "Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?"
- Point of View: From the perspective of an IT manager seeking more efficient resource utilization.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips
--------------------------
* Pacing: Ask students to pause and reflect on how hypervisors can improve their own virtual environments, such as cloud computing or server management.
* Analogy: Hypervisors could be compared to a conductor leading an orchestra; while each instrument has its unique sound, the conductor ensures they all work together in harmony by managing the resources efficiently.

### Interactive Activities for Hypervisors
1. Debate Topic: "Hypervisors improve resource utilization by allowing multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical host, but this performance overhead can significantly impact system performance."
The debate topic pits the strength of hypervisors (improved resource utilization) against their weaknesses (significant performance overhead). This encourages students to consider the trade-offs and evaluate whether it is worthwhile for them to adopt the use of hypervisors in their environment.
2. What If Scenario Question: "A school has two identical physical servers, each with 16GB RAM and a quad-core processor. The IT administrator wants to run five virtual machines on one server while running only one application on the other server. Which scenario would result in better performance for students accessing educational resources?"
Scenario A: Run the single application on the first server, allowing it to allocate all 16GB of RAM and full utilization of the quad-core processor, resulting in high performance for both virtual machines (VMs) and the student applications. Scenario B: Use a hypervisor to run five VMs on the second server, which will result in context switching between the different VMs, leading to slower application response times for students accessing educational resources. This scenario forces students to consider whether sacrificing some system performance for better resource utilization is worth it when using hypervisors.

## Teaching Module: Type 1 Hypervisor
1. The Story (Problem  ->  Solution  ->  Impact)

---

In a high-performance computing environment, administrators were struggling with managing multiple virtual machines on a single host machine. They found it difficult to allocate and balance resources efficiently between different VMs, leading to performance bottlenecks and reduced productivity. It was becoming clear that they needed a solution that would help them optimize resource allocation while maintaining low overhead.

---

One day, an engineer stumbled upon the concept of Type 1 hypervisors. These are special types of virtualization software that run directly on top of a host machine's hardware without requiring an underlying operating system. This direct interaction between the hypervisor and the hardware allowed for more efficient resource allocation, leading to better performance in managing virtual machines.
