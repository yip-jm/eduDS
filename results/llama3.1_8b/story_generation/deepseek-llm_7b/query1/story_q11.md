## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
1. The Story (Problem  ->   'Aha'! Moment  ->   Impact)

---

In the world of cloud computing, there was once a shared responsibility between cloud providers and users to keep data secure. This responsibility diagram divided security duties into three categories - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). While cloud providers handled some aspects like hardware maintenance and operating systems updates, the users still had to take care of securing their own applications, data, and networks. This shared responsibility model was challenging for both parties since it wasn't clear who should be responsible for what security measures in each category.

One day, a user realized that they could focus on developing their core competencies (applications, services) while the cloud provider took care of hardware maintenance and system updates - this opened new possibilities to innovate! This realization led to an 'Aha' moment: by sharing responsibility with providers, users can now leverage more resources for other critical tasks.

This model is important because it clarifies each party's roles in ensuring data security while promoting a collaborative approach to risk management. It encourages best practices and responsible data ownership among cloud users and motivates them to invest in necessary security services.

However, the shared responsibility model can be complex to understand and implement effectively; this trade-off is essential for both parties to navigate successfully. The clarity it brings about roles and responsibilities allows providers and users alike to achieve a higher level of security without compromising on their core competencies.

2. Storytelling Hooks
*Dramatic Question:* "Which party should bear the responsibility for securing your data in cloud computing? And, is there a way to share this responsibility while maintaining focus on developing innovative services?" 

*Point of View:* From the perspective of someone transitioning from a traditional IT setting into the world of cloud computing.

3. Classroom Delivery Tips
- Pacing: Start with an overview and gradually introduce more detailed explanations, interspersing relevant anecdotes or real-life examples to maintain interest.
- Analogy: Imagine the shared responsibility model as a partnership between two friends - one friend takes care of the house's security system (cloud provider), while the other focuses on locking their door at night (user secures data). Both contribute, but each is responsible for different aspects of safety.

### Interactive Activities for Shared Responsibility Model
1. Debate Topic: "The Shared Responsibility Model is essential for ensuring secure data practices in organizations." Discuss whether this model promotes collaboration between providers and users enough to overcome potential complexity when implementing it effectively, or if other security models are more suited for certain circumstances.
2. What If Scenario Question: "If a company adopts the Shared Responsibility Model without fully understanding its implications on data ownership and best practices, how would this affect their overall cybersecurity?" Have students evaluate possible negative consequences and suggest alternative actions to mitigate these issues while maintaining the benefits of shared responsibility.

## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management
1. The Story (Problem  ->   Solution  -> Impact)
-------------------------

In today's digital age, businesses and individuals rely heavily on cloud computing services for their daily operations. These services provide access to various applications and data from anywhere in the world with just a few clicks. However, this convenience comes at a cost - security risks. One of the most significant challenges faced by organizations is unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the cloud. This can lead to devastating consequences like financial losses, legal liabilities, or loss of reputation.

One day, while working on a project with his team, Joe discovered that they were using different methods to manage user identities and access to their data. Some colleagues were using shared passwords, while others relied on insecure authentication methods. This lack of standardization made it difficult for the team to track who had access to what information, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.

Joe's 'aha!' moment came when he learned about Identity & Access Management (IAM). IAM is a set of processes and tools that help organizations manage user identities and their access to cloud resources securely. With IAM, Joe could create different levels of permissions for each team member based on their roles and responsibilities within the project. This way, sensitive data would only be accessible by authorized users, eliminating potential security risks like unauthorized access or data breaches.

2. Storytelling Hooks
--------------------
- Dramatic Question: "Can you trust your cloud data without proper identity & access management?"
- Point of View: "As a cloud services administrator, learn how IAM can protect your organization's sensitive information."

3. Classroom Delivery Tips
-------------------------
- Pacing: When discussing the importance of Identity & Access Management, emphasize that it provides an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Then introduce the concept by explaining its definition and key points. Finally, discuss why it is significant for businesses in today's digital world.
- Analogies: You can compare IAM to a key holder who only gives access to a specific room or building based on the person's need and permission. This analogy helps students visualize how IAM works by assigning unique permissions to different users, ensuring secure data access.

### Interactive Activities for Identity/Access Management
1. Debate Topic: "Does Identity/Access Management provide enough security benefits in exchange for additional administrative workload?"
Statement: While identity/access management helps prevent unauthorized access to cloud resources, it also requires proper configuration and maintenance for effective security, leading to an increased burden on administrators. Discuss whether the advantages of IAD outweigh its drawbacks.

2. What If Scenario Question: "A company decides to implement a new Identity/Access Management system. The system is successful in preventing unauthorized access but causes significant administrative overhead due to frequent configuration changes and updates. After three months, there has been an increase in productivity as employees can easily log into their cloud-based resources. However, the IT department spends more time managing user accounts than before implementation. What would be a fair balance between security benefits of IAD and its impact on company productivity?"
