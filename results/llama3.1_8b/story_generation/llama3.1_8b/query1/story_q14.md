## Teaching Module: DevOps Culture
**The Story**

### The Problem (Event)

It was a typical Monday morning at TechCorp, a software development company that had seen significant growth in recent years. However, with this growth came new challenges - projects were taking longer to complete, quality control issues were on the rise, and teams seemed more disconnected than ever.

**Problem:** Teams from Business, Software Development, and IT Operations worked in silos, each focusing on their own tasks without much collaboration or communication. This led to misunderstandings, duplicated efforts, and an overall slower pace of development.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)

One day, a team of innovators at TechCorp discovered the concept of DevOps Culture - a culture and way of working that emphasizes collaboration between Business, Software Development, and IT Operations. They learned about its core principles:

* **Collaboration**: Emphasizes teamwork to improve communication and efficiency.
* **Cross-functional teams**: Encourages a shift from siloed operations to teams that work together seamlessly.
* **Continuous improvement**: Fosters a mindset of learning and adapting.

**Aha! Moment:** As they implemented these principles, the team noticed significant improvements in productivity, quality, and time-to-market. They realized that by working together and automating processes, they could make data-driven decisions and respond quickly to market demands.

### The Impact (Meaning)

The adoption of DevOps Culture had a profound impact on TechCorp. It improved collaboration and communication between teams, enhancing agility and responsiveness to change. However, it also required a significant cultural shift and mindset change, which was challenging for some team members to adapt to.

**Impact:** In the end, the benefits far outweighed the challenges. The company saw increased customer satisfaction, reduced costs, and faster time-to-market. Employees felt more engaged and motivated, working in an environment that valued teamwork and continuous improvement.

### Storytelling Hooks

* **Dramatic Question:** "Can a company really change its culture to improve efficiency, quality, and speed?"
* **Point of View:** "From the perspective of a team lead who had to navigate the challenges of adopting a new way of working."

### Classroom Delivery Tips

* **Pacing:**
	+ Pause after describing the problem at TechCorp to ask students if they've experienced similar issues.
	+ Ask students to share their thoughts on what could be done to improve communication and collaboration within teams.
* **Analogy:** Compare DevOps Culture to a well-oiled machine - each part working together in harmony to achieve a common goal.

As you deliver this story, encourage students to think critically about the challenges faced by TechCorp and how they can apply the principles of DevOps Culture in their own projects or workplaces.

### Interactive Activities for DevOps Culture
Here are two distinct items:

**Debate Topic:**

Title: "Embracing DevOps Culture: Is the Potential for Improved Collaboration Worth the Risk of Disrupting Established Silos?"

Statement: "A significant cultural shift towards a DevOps culture, despite its potential to enhance agility and responsiveness to change, should not be prioritized over maintaining traditional siloed structures in organizations."

This debate topic pits the strengths of DevOps Culture (improved collaboration and enhanced agility) against its weaknesses (significant cultural shift and challenging implementation). Students will have to argue for or against this statement, considering both sides' perspectives.

**What If Scenario Question:**

Title: "The Agile Dilemma"

Scenario:

"Imagine you are a project manager at a software development company that has traditionally operated with siloed teams. Your team leader has proposed implementing a DevOps culture to increase collaboration and responsiveness to customer needs. However, the organization's established structure is resistant to change, and some team members are concerned about losing their autonomy.

If you had to make a decision today, would you:

A) Prioritize the implementation of DevOps Culture, even if it means significant cultural shift and potential resistance from existing teams.
B) Maintain the current siloed structure, despite its limitations in terms of collaboration and agility.

Justify your choice by weighing the trade-offs between improving collaboration and responsiveness (strengths) against the challenges of implementing a new culture and disrupting established structures (weaknesses)."

This scenario forces students to apply the concept of DevOps Culture and consider its practical implications. By choosing an option, they must justify their decision based on the strengths and weaknesses of the concept.

## Teaching Module: CI/CD
### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
**"The Nightmares of Manual Testing"**
Meet Emily, a software development team lead at a small startup called "QuickFix". Her team had been working tirelessly to meet an upcoming deadline for their new app's release. However, with each new feature added, the complexity of testing and deployment grew exponentially. Bugs were frequently introduced during manual deployment, causing delays and frustration among the team. The constant back-and-forth between development, quality assurance, and deployment was like a never-ending puzzle that nobody could solve.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
**"The Magical Automation Wand"**
One fateful evening, Emily stumbled upon an article discussing Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD). Intrigued by the idea of automating the build, test, and deployment process, she decided to give it a try. She explained CI/CD to her team as a technical workflow that enables continuous integration and delivery of software changes. In simple terms, they could write code, commit it into version control, and have their automated workflows automatically build, test, and deploy the application without human intervention. This included automating the process with tools like Jenkins for Continuous Integration (CI) and then using a tool like Docker to streamline deployment.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
**"The Transformation: Efficiency and Quality Unleashed"**
As Emily's team started implementing CI/CD, they noticed an immediate reduction in the time spent on testing and deployment. Bugs were caught early and fixed swiftly because automated tests ran continuously as code was updated. This not only saved them a lot of manual effort but also improved product quality significantly. With CI/CD, QuickFix could deploy changes faster than ever before, which gave their competitors a run for their money in terms of time-to-market. However, implementing CI/CD wasn't without its challenges; the initial investment was substantial, and sometimes, it seemed like more complexity was added rather than reduced.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Can automating every step of software development really make it easier to deliver high-quality applications faster?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of a team lead trying to navigate the challenges of manual testing and deployment.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing
