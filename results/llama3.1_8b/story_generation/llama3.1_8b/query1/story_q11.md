## Teaching Module: Shared Responsibility Model
**Shared Responsibility Model: A Tale of Two Clouds**

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
Imagine a world where companies and individuals are moving their data to the cloud at an unprecedented rate. However, with this shift comes a growing concern about security in the cloud. Without clear guidelines on who is responsible for what, data owners and providers alike are left wondering: "Who's going to keep our data safe?"

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
Enter the Shared Responsibility Model, a game-changer in cloud security. This model divides responsibilities between cloud providers and users into three clear categories: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). For instance:

- In IaaS, both provider and user share responsibility for security.
- With PaaS, the provider handles security but still expects users to follow best practices.
- For SaaS, the provider is fully responsible for security.

Data owners must understand their role in securing data by following best practices and purchasing/leasing necessary security services. This not only promotes collaboration between providers and users but also encourages responsible data ownership.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The Shared Responsibility Model matters because it clarifies roles and responsibilities, fostering a collaborative approach to risk management. By understanding what's expected of them, both cloud providers and users can ensure better security outcomes. However, this model requires careful implementation and adherence to best practices, as its complexity can sometimes lead to confusion.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

- **Dramatic Question**: "Can a shared responsibility model really make the cloud safer for all?"
- **Point of View**: "From the perspective of an IT manager trying to secure their company's data in the cloud."

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

- **Pacing**:
  - Pause after describing the problem to ask: "Have you ever worried about your data's security when using cloud services?"
  - After explaining the model, pause and ask: "How do you think this changes the way companies approach cloud security?"
  
- **Analogy**: Use a house as an analogy. Imagine a house with shared walls (like IaaS), where both the owner and the landlord are responsible for maintaining the structure's integrity but in different ways. In contrast, a fully managed apartment building (like SaaS) has a single entity (the landlord) responsible for everything, including security.

This story module is designed to make the Shared Responsibility Model accessible and memorable for your students, emphasizing its importance in cloud security through a relatable narrative.

### Interactive Activities for Shared Responsibility Model
Here are two items based on the Shared Responsibility Model:

**Debate Topic:**

Title: "Shared Responsibility Models Prioritize Collaboration Over Complexity"

Statement: "In modern cybersecurity practices, the benefits of shared responsibility models, such as promoting collaboration between providers and users for better security outcomes, outweigh their potential complexity."

Instructions:
- Students will be divided into two groups to argue for or against the statement.
- Each group must provide evidence from real-world examples or hypothetical scenarios to support their position.
- The opposing team should challenge the arguments presented by countering with the complexity and potential drawbacks of shared responsibility models.

**What If Scenario Question:**

Title: "Cybersecurity Dilemma"

Scenario:

"Company XYZ is planning a cloud migration project that involves sensitive customer data. As part of the Shared Responsibility Model, they have identified their responsibility for securing customer credentials and have partnered with an external provider for infrastructure security. However, during implementation, it becomes clear that the cost of meeting all security requirements exceeds budget expectations.

What do you recommend Company XYZ do to balance their responsibility for security outcomes while minimizing costs? Justify your decision using specific trade-offs from the Shared Responsibility Model."

Instructions:
- Students will work individually or in pairs to propose a solution.
- They should provide a clear explanation of their choice, addressing both the benefits (collaboration and best practices) and drawbacks (complexity) associated with the Shared Responsibility Model.
- Encourage students to consider real-world implications of their decision, such as potential security risks and compliance issues.

## Teaching Module: Identity/Access Management
**Story Module: "The Cloud Castle"**

### The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
In the land of Cloudville, a kingdom of digital resources and services, a great concern arose among its rulers. A malicious sorcerer had infiltrated the castle walls, accessing sensitive data without permission. This unauthorized access threatened the security of the entire realm. The rulers realized they needed to protect their kingdom from such invasions.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, a wise architect of Cloudville, familiar with the ancient art of identity management, discovered a set of magical keys. These were the services provided by cloud providers like AWS IAM. By configuring these services correctly, one could ensure that only authorized users possessed the keys to access the castle's resources. The architect shared this knowledge with the rulers, explaining how users must configure AWS IAM properly for secure access and how data owners are responsible for securing their data through best practices.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The introduction of identity management services in Cloudville significantly improved its security. By implementing these services correctly, the risk of unauthorized access was greatly reduced. This safeguarded not only the castle's resources but also the data within it. Although there were challenges to proper configuration and maintenance for effective security, the benefits far outweighed the costs. The rulers realized that identity management was crucial in maintaining their kingdom's integrity and preventing future invasions.

### Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
Could a simple key unlock a castle full of digital treasures, but also put them at risk if not managed properly?

#### Point of View
From the perspective of a cloud security engineer tasked with protecting sensitive data in Cloudville.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing
- Pause after describing the problem (The Problem) to ask students: "Have you ever accessed a digital service without fully understanding its security measures?"
- After explaining the solution (The 'Aha!' Moment), pause and ask: "How would you configure AWS IAM services in your own cloud projects?"
- When discussing the impact (The Impact), pause again for reflection, asking: "Why do you think identity management is crucial for cloud security?"

#### Analogy
Imagine Cloudville as a large office building with many rooms. Each room represents a digital resource or service. Identity management works like a secure keycard system, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to the right areas (resources) at the right time.

**Teaching Note:** This story is designed to be engaging and easy to follow, making it accessible for students of all backgrounds. Encourage discussion and participation by asking questions related to each section.

### Interactive Activities for Identity/Access Management
Here are two interactive classroom elements designed to foster critical thinking:

## Teaching Module: Data Protection Responsibilities in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
**The Story**

### 1. The Problem (Event)

In a world where data is the new gold, companies are moving their operations to the cloud with lightning speed. However, this shift has created a complex web of responsibilities when it comes to protecting sensitive information. Companies have realized that they can't just rely on their cloud providers to safeguard their data, but rather must understand and adhere to best practices for each specific cloud offering.

### 2. The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)

Meet Emma, a seasoned IT manager who had been dealing with the aftermath of a data breach in one of her company's IaaS projects. She was shocked to discover that her team had assumed the cloud provider would handle security measures, only to find out they were solely responsible for securing their own data. This experience led her to delve deeper into the concept of data protection responsibilities across different cloud offerings - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service).

Emma learned that in IaaS, users are fully responsible for securing their data. They must configure firewalls, set up encryption, and implement access controls to prevent unauthorized access. She also discovered that while PaaS providers offer some security features, such as user authentication and authorization, it's still the users' responsibility to configure these correctly to ensure the highest level of protection.

However, Emma was relieved to find out that SaaS providers manage most security aspects for them, including updates, backups, and access controls. This meant her team could focus on their core business rather than worrying about the technical details of data protection.

### 3. The Impact (Meaning)

Emma's journey taught her a valuable lesson: understanding the varying levels of responsibility between cloud providers and users in different offerings is crucial for effective data protection. By acknowledging these differences, companies can ensure that sensitive information remains secure.

This concept matters because it promotes clear understanding and adherence to best practices across all cloud offerings. It encourages companies to prioritize data protection by acknowledging their specific responsibilities rather than assuming the provider will handle everything. This approach reduces the risk of data breaches and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.

However, this concept can be confusing due to the varying levels of responsibility between providers and users. To mitigate this challenge, companies must invest time in educating themselves about each cloud offering's unique data protection landscape.

**Storytelling Hooks**

* **Dramatic Question**: "Can a company truly secure its data without understanding its responsibilities in the cloud?"
* **Point of View**: "From the perspective of an IT manager navigating the complexities of cloud security."

**Classroom Delivery Tips**

* **Pacing**: Pause after introducing Emma's problem to ask students if they have experienced similar situations. Ask them to reflect on their current understanding of data protection responsibilities in the cloud.
* **Analogy**: Compare the varying levels of responsibility between cloud providers and users to a three-tiered cake, where each tier represents IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS. Explain how each provider is responsible for its specific layer but requires user input to ensure overall security.

This structured story aims to engage students by making the concept of data protection responsibilities in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS relatable and memorable.

### Interactive Activities for Data Protection Responsibilities in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
Here are two interactive elements designed to foster critical thinking in the classroom:

**1. Debate Topic: "Cloud providers hold greater data protection responsibilities than users themselves."**

This debate topic pits the strengths of clear understanding and best practices against the weaknesses of confusion due to varying levels of responsibility. Students will be encouraged to argue for or against this statement, considering both sides of the coin:

*   Those arguing in favor will highlight how cloud providers often have more control over data protection measures, making them more accountable.
*   Those arguing against will emphasize that users still have significant responsibilities in protecting their data, such as choosing secure passwords and keeping software up-to-date.

**2. What If Scenario Question: "A small business is considering a migration to PaaS for its e-commerce platform. However, this would require the company's developers to access sensitive customer information through the platform's API. How would you balance the benefits of using PaaS (e.g., scalability, cost-effectiveness) with the risks associated with exposing sensitive data?"**

This scenario forces students to apply their understanding of data protection responsibilities in different cloud offerings and weigh the trade-offs involved in choosing a particular service model. Students will need to consider:

*   The level of responsibility that falls on the PaaS provider versus the users (in this case, the developers)
*   The potential risks associated with exposing sensitive customer information
*   Strategies for mitigating these risks while still benefiting from the advantages of using PaaS

Both of these elements are designed to promote critical thinking and encourage students to engage with the concept in a more nuanced way.
