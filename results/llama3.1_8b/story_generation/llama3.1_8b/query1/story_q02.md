## Teaching Module: Operating System Level Virtualisation
### The Story

#### The Problem (Event)
It was a typical Monday morning at DataCorp, a growing tech firm that specialized in e-commerce solutions. Their IT team, led by Alex, was facing a critical challenge. With increasing demands from clients and employees alike, their physical servers were struggling to keep up with the workload. Each server was being heavily utilized, leaving little room for expansion or upgrade. The team knew they needed a solution that would allow them to maximize resource utilization without breaking the bank on new hardware.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while attending a conference, Alex stumbled upon an innovative approach called Operating System Level Virtualisation. She was intrigued by its promise of providing multiple virtual environments, similar to dedicated servers, using isolation mechanisms. This meant no modification of the guest operating system would be required, making it an attractive solution for DataCorp's needs.

As she delved deeper into the concept, Alex understood that OS-level virtualisation leveraged existing hardware and software resources more efficiently than traditional methods. It allowed multiple virtual environments to run on a single physical host, thereby improving resource utilization and flexibility. The 'Aha!' moment was clear: by implementing OS-level virtualisation, DataCorp could significantly enhance their computing capabilities without the need for expensive upgrades.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The implementation of Operating System Level Virtualisation at DataCorp had a profound impact on their operations. With improved resource utilization, they were able to accommodate more clients and projects than ever before. This not only increased revenue but also allowed them to offer enhanced services to existing clients, further solidifying their market position.

However, as Alex later noted in a team meeting, there was a trade-off. The isolation mechanisms required for virtualization sometimes led to performance overheads, which could impact applications requiring high speeds. Despite this limitation, the benefits of OS-level virtualisation far outweighed its drawbacks, making it a crucial component of DataCorp's IT strategy.

### Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
"Can we make our computers more efficient by treating them like dumb servers?"

#### Point of View
"This story is told from Alex's perspective as she navigates the challenges and solutions in her role as an IT team leader."

### Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing
- Pause after introducing the problem to allow students to consider their own experiences with resource constraints.
- Ask a question, such as "Have you ever worked on a project where your computer seemed too slow?" before explaining the concept of OS-level virtualisation.

#### Analogy
"Think of operating system level virtualisation like renting apartments in a building. Each 'virtual apartment' (or environment) is isolated from others, just like each physical server would be if it were dedicated, but they all share the same 'building' (the host machine), maximizing space and efficiency."

This analogy helps students visualize the concept of virtualisation as a practical solution for making the most out of available resources.

### Interactive Activities for Operating System Level Virtualisation

## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
**Para-Virtualisation: The Tale of Efficient Machines**

### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

#### The Problem (Event)
In a bustling data center, hundreds of servers hummed with activity, each running its own operating system to manage tasks efficiently. However, as demand soared, the IT team faced a challenge: how to make these servers work together seamlessly without sacrificing performance. The current setup was cumbersome, requiring complex configurations and manual tweaking to achieve optimal utilization.

#### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, an engineer named Alex stumbled upon a revolutionary concept that would change the game for virtualization. Para-Virtualisation, she discovered, required modifying the guest operating system to use hooks â€“ strategic points of interaction with the hypervisor. This clever hack allowed the guest OS to communicate more effectively with the host machine, significantly improving execution simulation and efficiency.

The guest OS was no longer treated as a standalone entity but rather as an integral part of the virtualized environment. The set of hooks enabled precise control over resource allocation, eliminating bottlenecks and enabling each server to run at its best. With para-virtualization, Alex realized that making computers work together would not only make them more efficient but also simpler to manage.

#### The Impact (Meaning)
The introduction of Para-Virtualisation had a profound impact on the data center's operations. Servers ran smoother, resources were utilized better, and IT teams saved time by automating many tasks. However, this innovative approach came with a trade-off: modifying the guest OS required significant effort upfront. Alex knew that while para-virtualization offered improved performance and efficiency, it was crucial to weigh these benefits against the initial complexity of implementation.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

#### Dramatic Question
"Could making computers work together actually make them smarter?"

#### Point of View
From the perspective of an engineer like Alex, who faces the challenge of optimizing a complex system.

## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
**The Story**
===============

### The Problem (Event)

It was a typical Monday morning at CyberSpace Corporation, and our team of engineers were struggling with a project deadline. Our client, a renowned e-commerce company, required us to deploy their new application on multiple servers across different locations. However, we soon realized that each server had its own unique hardware configuration, making it nearly impossible to manage and maintain.

Our team lead, Rachel, exclaimed, "We can't afford to have our developers troubleshoot issues related to different hardware configurations! It's a nightmare!" The team was at their wit's end, trying to find a solution that would allow them to focus on the application development rather than dealing with server-specific problems.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)

Just then, our resident expert in virtualization technology, John, walked into the room. He overheard Rachel's frustration and chimed in, "Have you guys considered full virtualization?" Rachel replied, puzzled, "What does that even mean?" John explained, "Full virtualization simulates all the hardware of the underlying device by providing a virtual machine to the guest operating system. This means we can create multiple virtual environments on one physical server, each with its own custom configuration."

John elaborated, "Here are some key points about full virtualization: it fully simulates all the hardware of the underlying device, provides a virtual machine to the guest operating system, and has higher inherent virtualization cost due to the need for the VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor) to go through many more layers of software." The team listened intently as John demonstrated how this technology would solve their problems.

### The Impact (Meaning)

With full virtualization, our team was finally able to deploy the client's application across multiple servers without worrying about hardware configurations. Each virtual environment was self-contained and isolated from the others, ensuring better security and stability. As Rachel put it, "We can now focus on developing applications rather than dealing with server-specific issues!"

However, John also cautioned that full virtualization comes with performance trade-offs due to its complexity. He explained that while it provides a complete and self-contained virtual environment, allowing for better isolation and security, the inherent virtualization cost is higher. This means that there's a slight decrease in system performance.

**Storytelling Hooks**
=====================

### Dramatic Question

*Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?*

### Point of View

Tell the story from John's perspective as the expert who introduces full virtualization to the team, highlighting his role in solving their problems.

**Classroom Delivery Tips**
==========================

### Pacing

- Pause for 2-3 seconds after Rachel exclaims, "We can't afford to have our developers troubleshoot issues related to different hardware configurations!"
- Ask a question: "Can anyone think of a way to manage and maintain servers with different hardware configurations?"
- Resume the story after John's explanation.

### Analogy

Use the analogy of a city with multiple districts. Just as each district has its own unique culture, architecture, and infrastructure, full virtualization allows for multiple self-contained environments on one physical server, each with its own custom configuration.

### Interactive Activities for Full Virtualisation
**Item 1: Debate Topic**

**Title:** "Should Virtualization Strategies Prioritize Performance or Security?"

**Debate Statement:**

"While full virtualisation offers unparalleled isolation and security benefits, its higher inherent cost and complexity may outweigh these advantages in production environments."

*   Assign students to either the **Pro-Performance** team (supporting the idea that virtualization strategies should prioritize performance) or the **Pro-Security** team (arguing that security should take precedence).
*   Provide each team with a set of prepared arguments based on the strengths and weaknesses of full virtualisation.
*   Have the teams prepare a presentation to present their stance, incorporating examples and logical reasoning.
*   Allow for rebuttals and counterarguments from opposing teams.

**Item 2: What If Scenario Question**

**Title:** "Optimizing Virtualization in a Resource-Constrained Environment"

**Scenario:**

"A large organization is migrating its server infrastructure to the cloud. However, due to budget constraints, they can only allocate a limited amount of resources for virtualization. They must decide between implementing full virtualisation or a different virtualization strategy.

Instructions:

*   Present students with this scenario and ask them to choose which virtualization approach (full virtualisation or an alternative) they would recommend.
*   Encourage them to justify their decision based on the trade-offs of each option, considering both performance and security implications.
*   Provide space for discussion and peer review, emphasizing the importance of weighing the strengths and weaknesses of full virtualisation in this specific context.

By engaging with these activities, students will develop critical thinking skills by analyzing complex information, identifying pros and cons, and making informed decisions based on the trade-offs involved.
