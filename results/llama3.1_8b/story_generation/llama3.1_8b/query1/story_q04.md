## Teaching Module: Docker
**The Story**

### The Problem (Event)
Imagine it's the year 2022, and you're part of a team developing a new e-commerce platform. Your team is working on a tight deadline to deploy the application across multiple servers. However, each server has its own operating system, which means that deploying the application on each server requires different settings and configurations. This leads to a nightmare scenario where your team spends more time figuring out how to set up environments than actually coding.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while researching ways to simplify deployment, you stumble upon Docker. You learn that it's a containerization platform that allows developers to package their applications in a single container, which can then be run on any system with Docker installed. This means that your application will behave the same way on every server, regardless of the underlying operating system.

Docker works by providing operating system-level virtualization for applications. This means that containers share the kernel of the host operating system but have their own isolated user-space. Containers are lightweight and can be easily shared between systems because they don't require a full hypervisor to run.

### The Impact (Meaning)
With Docker, your team can package the application once and deploy it across all servers with just a few commands. This leads to faster development cycles because you no longer have to spend time configuring environments for each server. Moreover, collaboration becomes easier among teams since they can work on their respective parts of the project without worrying about compatibility issues between different operating systems.

However, there's a trade-off. Docker requires significant system resources, which can impact performance in large-scale deployments. This means you need to carefully plan your infrastructure and monitor resource utilization when using Docker.

### Dramatic Question
Could packaging an application into its own 'box' actually make it easier to deploy across multiple servers?

### Point of View
From the perspective of a team lead trying to streamline the development process for a large-scale application.

### Classroom Delivery Tips

#### Pacing
- Pause after describing the problem to ask: "How many of you have struggled with setting up environments or dealing with compatibility issues?"
- Pause again when explaining Docker's benefits to ask: "What would your workflow look like if you could package an application once and deploy it everywhere?"

#### Analogy
Imagine running a restaurant. Just as you'd want all your dishes to be prepared in the same kitchen, regardless of where they're served, Docker is like creating a portable 'kitchen' for applications that can run consistently on any system.

**Additional Tips**

- Use visual aids or examples from real-world projects to illustrate how Docker works.
- Discuss scenarios where Docker might not be the best solution (e.g., performance-critical applications) to highlight its trade-offs.
- Encourage students to think about how they could apply this concept in their own projects.

### Interactive Activities for Docker
**Debate Topic:**

**"Docker's benefits outweigh its drawbacks in large-scale deployments."**

This debate topic pits the strengths of Docker (fast and lightweight deployment, support for various programming languages and frameworks) against its weaknesses (significant system resource requirements). Students can argue for or against this statement based on real-world scenarios, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of using Docker in different contexts.

**What If Scenario Question:**

**"Your company is planning to deploy a new e-commerce application that expects a massive surge in traffic during holiday seasons. Docker has been recommended as a deployment solution. However, your team is concerned about potential performance issues due to system resource requirements. What would you do? Would you opt for Docker or consider alternative solutions? Justify your decision."**

This scenario forces students to apply the concept of Docker and its trade-offs in a real-world context. They must weigh the benefits (fast and lightweight deployment, support for various programming languages and frameworks) against the potential drawbacks (significant system resource requirements). By considering the needs of their company's application and the limitations of Docker, students will develop critical thinking skills to navigate complex technical decisions.

## Teaching Module: Singularity
**The Story**

### The Problem (Event)

Dr. Maria Hernandez was a renowned astrophysicist leading a team of researchers at a top-tier university. Their mission was to simulate complex weather patterns on distant planets using high-performance computing (HPC) environments. However, their development cycles were plagued by inconsistencies and inefficiencies across different HPC systems.

Each researcher had to navigate the intricacies of adapting their applications for specific hardware configurations, leading to frustrating delays and errors. Moreover, sharing code and collaborating with colleagues became a logistical nightmare due to the differences in system environments. Despite her team's brilliant ideas, Dr. Hernandez felt like they were stuck in the Stone Age when it came to deploying their simulations.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)

One fateful day, while attending a conference on HPC advancements, Dr. Hernandez stumbled upon an innovative solution presented by a colleague from another institution: Singularity. This containerization platform promised to revolutionize how applications were packaged and run in HPC environments. She was intrigued by the prospect of having her team's applications run consistently across different systems, without the need for complex modifications.

With renewed enthusiasm, Dr. Hernandez explored Singularity further. She discovered that it not only provided a way to package applications but also granted access to underlying hardware resources from within containers. This meant her team could develop and deploy their simulations using their preferred programming languages – including Fortran, C++, and Python – without worrying about system-specific constraints.

### The Impact (Meaning)

The adoption of Singularity by Dr. Hernandez's team was nothing short of transformative. By packaging their applications in consistent containers that accessed hardware resources directly, they significantly reduced the time spent on development and deployment. Collaboration improved dramatically as researchers could share code seamlessly across different systems, streamlining their workflow.

While there were some drawbacks – such as increased system resource requirements for large-scale deployments – Dr. Hernandez's team found these trade-offs to be worthwhile. They could now focus on pushing the boundaries of scientific discovery rather than wrestling with technical inefficiencies. The singularity platform had effectively made their high-performance computing environment more agile, efficient, and productive.

**Storytelling Hooks**

### Dramatic Question
Could a tool that makes computers 'dumber' by encapsulating applications in containers actually make them smarter by improving collaboration and efficiency?

### Point of View
From the perspective of Dr. Maria Hernandez, an astrophysicist navigating the challenges of high-performance computing environments.

**Classroom Delivery Tips**

### Pacing

- Pause after describing the problem faced by Dr. Hernandez's team to ask: "How often have you struggled with compatibility issues between different software or hardware configurations?"
- After introducing Singularity, pause again and ask the class to consider how this platform could be applied in their own projects.

### Analogy
Explain Singularity using a shipping analogy:
"Imagine sending packages across the country. Normally, each package needs to fit perfectly into its destination's specific container, or it won't arrive as intended. But what if you could package your application like a gift box that can be opened and used by any system, without needing custom modifications? That's essentially what Singularity does – it creates a 'gift box' for your applications that can run consistently across different HPC environments."

### Interactive Activities for Singularity
Here are the two items as requested:

**1. Debate Topic: "Singularity's Double-Edged Sword"**

**Statement:** "While Singularity offers unparalleled flexibility in accessing underlying hardware resources and supports a wide range of programming languages, its significant system resource requirements outweigh these benefits, making it a hindrance to large-scale deployments."

**Instructions for the debate:**

*   Assign students roles as proponents or opponents of the statement.
*   Encourage them to gather evidence from various sources (academic papers, industry reports, online forums) to support their stance.
*   During the debate, focus on the trade-offs between flexibility and scalability.

**2. What If Scenario Question: "The High-Performance Computing Conundrum"**

**Scenario:** A research institution is considering Singularity for a high-performance computing project that requires extensive computational resources. However, the team has limited budget and needs to decide whether to prioritize performance or scalability.

**Question:** "If you were part of this research institution, would you opt for Singularity despite its potential impact on system resource usage? Justify your decision based on the strengths and weaknesses of the technology."

**Instructions for students:**

*   Ask them to weigh the pros (flexibility, wide language support) against the cons (significant system resource requirements).
*   Encourage them to consider alternative solutions that balance performance and scalability.
*   As they work through this scenario, emphasize the importance of understanding trade-offs in real-world problem-solving.

These two items aim to facilitate a deeper understanding of Singularity's benefits and drawbacks.

## Teaching Module: Linux Containers (LXC)
**The Story**

### The Problem (Event)
Imagine you're part of a team developing a new web application. Your codebase is complex, and deploying it on different environments is like solving a puzzle every time. You need to ensure compatibility with various operating systems, programming languages, and frameworks. It's frustrating and time-consuming. This was the reality for developers before Linux Containers (LXC) came into the picture.

### The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)
One day, while working late, you stumbled upon LXC. Your curiosity led you to explore what it's all about. You discovered that LXC provides operating system-level virtualization for applications. It allows multiple isolated containers to run on a single host, sharing the same kernel as the host OS. This means your code can run in its own self-contained environment without affecting the host or other containers. Your mind started racing with possibilities: "What if I could package my application consistently and deploy it easily across different environments?"

### The Impact (Meaning)
With LXC, you can now focus on writing great code, knowing that deployment becomes a breeze. You can package your application in a consistent manner, making it easier to manage and collaborate with your team. But, as with any technology, there are trade-offs. LXC requires significant system resources, which might impact performance in large-scale deployments. However, the benefits far outweigh the costs: faster development cycles, improved collaboration, and reduced deployment headaches.

**Storytelling Hooks**

### Dramatic Question
Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?

### Point of View
From the perspective of a developer struggling to deploy applications across different environments, we'll explore how LXC transforms this challenge into an opportunity for innovation and efficiency.

**Classroom Delivery Tips**

### Pacing
Pause after describing the problem (The Problem) and ask students: "How do you think developers would feel about deploying their code on multiple environments?" This encourages empathy and sets up the importance of finding a solution like LXC.

### Analogy
Explain LXC by comparing it to shipping containers. Just as shipping containers allow for efficient transportation of goods, LXC allows for efficient packaging and deployment of applications across different environments. This analogy helps students visualize how LXC works and its benefits.
