## Teaching Module: Pay-per-use Cloud Elasticity
### 1. The Story

**The Problem**

Imagine you are a gardener with a tiny plot of land and a dream to grow a vast array of vegetables. You start small, but as your success grows, so does your need for more soil, water, and sunlight—resources that are expensive and limited.

**The 'Aha!' Moment**

One day, a wise old farmer explains to you the concept of **pay-per-use cloud elasticity**. He tells you about a magical garden where seeds grow into plants only when you water them, and the amount of water you use directly correlates with how big they grow. This way, you don’t have to worry about finding huge plots of land or having too much water when it's not needed. The garden expands and shrinks based on your actual needs.

**The Impact**

This “magical” garden, also known as cloud computing, transforms your gardening—er, business. You no longer need to invest in a massive farm upfront. Instead, you pay only for what you use. This flexibility means you can scale up quickly during peak seasons and shrink back down when demand is low, saving money. However, managing this elasticity requires careful planning to avoid either withering plants (under-provisioning) or flooding the garden (over-provisioning). Understanding this balance makes your operation efficient and cost-effective.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks
