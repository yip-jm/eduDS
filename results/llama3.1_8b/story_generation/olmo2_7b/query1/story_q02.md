## Teaching Module: Para-Virtualisation
### 1. The Story (Problem -> Solution -> Impact)

**The Problem (Event)**: In a world of ever-evolving technology, an engineer named Alex was tasked with creating a highly efficient virtual environment to host multiple operating systems on a single server. However, the existing virtualization techniques were proving to be too resource-intensive and slow, causing significant delays in processing power and leading to suboptimal utilization of hardware.

**The 'Aha!' Moment (Experience)**: One day, Alex stumbled upon the concept of para-virtualization. It was like discovering a secret passage in a castle - a way to improve performance without requiring the guest operating systems to be completely oblivious to the virtual environment they were running in. The concept revolved around modifying these guest OSes with special hooks that would communicate directly with the hypervisor, allowing for more efficient machine execution simulation.

**The Impact (Meaning)**: Para-virtualization was a revelation because it bridged the gap between full hardware emulation and unmodified guest operating systems, offering a middle ground that improved performance and efficiency. **The strengths** of para-virtualization included better resource utilization and enhanced performance in virtualized environments. However, its **weaknesses** were rooted in the necessity for modifications to the guest operating systems, which could be time-consuming and complex. Despite these challenges, para-virtualization was significant because it empowered engineers like Alex to achieve high levels of efficiency and performance in their virtualized systems, laying the groundwork for more advanced and scalable cloud computing environments.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**: "Could making a computer dumber, by allowing it to cooperate with guest operating systems, actually make it smarter in the way it manages resources?"

**Point of View**: Narrate the story from Alex's perspective, as an engineer deeply engaged in problem-solving and innovation.

## Teaching Module: Full Virtualisation
### 1. The Story

**The Problem**

Imagine you're a computer engineer tasked with developing software that needs to run seamlessly across different hardware platforms. Before full virtualization, every time a new piece of hardware was introduced, the software had to be rewritten or heavily modified to work correctly, leading to inefficiencies and compatibility issues. This situation posed a significant challenge because it limited the portability and scalability of software applications.

**The 'Aha!' Moment**

One day, a breakthrough moment came when the concept of full virtualization was discovered. This method fully simulates all the hardware of the underlying device by creating a virtual environment that acts as a layer between the physical hardware and the guest operating system. This layer, known as the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), allows the guest OS to interact with what it believes is real hardware through virtual devices.

The **Definition** of full virtualization states that it fully simulates all the hardware of the underlying device by providing a virtual machine to the guest operating system. This means that the guest OS sees a complete, virtualized version of the hardware, which includes processors, memory, storage, and I/O devices. The **Key_Points** are crucial here: Full virtualization provides a complete and self-contained virtual environment, which allows for better isolation and security. However, it comes with a higher inherent virtualization cost because the VMM must go through many more layers of software to manage these virtual resources.

**The Impact**

Full virtualization is significant because it provides a complete and self-contained virtual environment that mimics real hardware, enabling software applications to be run on any compatible hardware without modification. This portability is crucial for businesses and developers, making their software more versatile and cost-effective to deploy. On the downside, the **Weaknesses** include the higher inherent virtualization cost due to the complexity of the VMM managing multiple layers of virtualized resources. Despite this, the **Strengths** such as improved isolation and security make it a valuable tool in modern computing infrastructure.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question**

"Could making a computer dumber actually make it smarter?"

**Point of View**

From the perspective of an engineer facing the challenge of ensuring software compatibility across various hardware platforms, the discovery of full virtualization brought about a profound shift in approach and understanding.

### 3. Classroom Delivery Tips

**Pacing**

Begin with **The Problem** to immediately engage students by presenting a real-world issue. Pause here to ask, "Have you ever tried to run an app on a different device only to encounter problems? That's the problem full virtualization solves!" Follow up with **The 'Aha!' Moment** to intrigue them with the concept's ingenuity and explain why it was a turning point.

**Analogy**

To help students grasp full virtualization, use the analogy of running a computer game on an emulator. Imagine the physical hardware of the game console being replaced by software (the VMM) that creates a virtual version of the console within your PC. This allows games to run on your PC without needing the actual console hardware—similar to how full virtualization enables software to run on any compatible hardware.
