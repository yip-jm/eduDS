## Teaching Module: Cloud-Native
### 1. The Story

**The Problem:** Before the advent of the cloud-native approach, companies found themselves bogged down by slow software release cycles and rigid infrastructure that couldn't keep up with the pace of business needs. Developers often faced long waits to deploy new features, and scaling was a cumbersome process that frequently led to bottlenecks.

**The 'Aha!' Moment:** Imagine an engineer at a large tech company named Alex. Frustrated by these perennial challenges, Alex stumbles upon a discussion about cloud-native practices during a company retreat. It's like discovering a roadmap to building a fleet of nimble, self-sufficient cars (containers) that can adapt to any road condition (scalability needs) without needing major overhauls (like refitting for different tasks). Furthermore, Alex learns about continuous deployment – the idea that new versions of the software can be tested and deployed automatically, much like a well-oiled assembly line.

**The Impact:** The discovery of cloud-native best practices was a revelation. It promised a future where companies could rapidly innovate and respond to market changes with agility unmatched before. This approach not only solved the problem of slow deployments but also paved the way for more flexible and scalable applications. However, Alex also realized that transitioning to this new paradigm would require significant shifts in company culture and processes – it was like converting an old-school car manufacturing plant into a high-tech, fully automated facility.

### 2. Storytelling Hooks

**Dramatic Question:** "Could transforming our software development process turn our company from a slow-moving dinosaur into a fleet of swift and adaptable birds?"

**Point of View:** From the perspective of Alex, an engineer who witnessed firsthand the limitations of traditional development practices and the transformative power of cloud-native principles.
