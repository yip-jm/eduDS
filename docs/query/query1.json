We introduced a simple model which is a kind of evolution of the client/server architecture. We broke the tight connection between the server and the client and introduced the concept of a “broker” which enable a client to find the appropriate services. The new architecture will only work if we (1) “standardize” the communication between the client and the server (2) hide the implementation of the service from the client. The latter is achieved by introducing an abstract interface which only tells the client how it can invoke the service.

        "Overall_Summary": "A lesson on cloud standards and compliance should explain that using the cloud securely requires adherence to established rules. 'Compliance' is the process of proving that a cloud provider meets specific requirements, such as those in NIST guidelines or ISO standards. This is crucial for security and is often a legal necessity. Organizations like the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) provide tools and certifications, like the STAR registry, to help customers verify a provider's compliance. Beyond security, 'standards' from bodies like the DMTF (which created the OVF standard for portable VMs) are vital for 'interoperability.' Interoperability ensures that services from different cloud providers can work together, which is essential for building secure multi-cloud solutions and avoiding being locked into a single vendor."
