A key advantage of synchronous systems is that the assumptions of global time and bounded message delay can make it easier to implement certain applications. For example, in case of online shopping, at a query to purchase a product, it can be checked and the customer can be informed whether the item is available before starting the checkout process, preventing a mismatch between inventory and sales (see also chapter 16 on distributed transactions). Synchronous systems will play a crucial role in coping with what are called Byzantine failures, in chapter 13.\n\nA synchronizer turns a network with asynchronous communication into a synchronous system. It must make sure that a process only moves to the next pulse when it has received all messages for its current pulse. This allows one to develop a distributed algorithm for synchronous systems, which in some cases is easier than developing it for a setting with fully asynchronous communication. Then a synchronizer can be used to make this algorithm applicable to general networks."

Synchronous systems will play a crucial role in coping with what are called Byzantine failures, in chapter 13.\n\nA synchronizer turns a network with asynchronous communication into a synchronous system. It must make sure that a process only moves to the next pulse when it has received all messages for its current pulse.

The problem of failures can be alleviated by including redundancy and replication in the system and letting processes negotiate before a certain action is taken. A typical example is a database management system in which the processes collectively decide whether to commit or abort a distributed transaction (see section 16.2). In sections 3.3 and 6.5, crashed processes were already considered for the specific challenges of rollback recovery and termination detection. A basic assumption we made in those two sections and also in the current chapter is that the network topology is complete. This guarantees that the network topology always stays strongly connected, even when processes have crashed. (Thus it is reasonable to assume that processes know the network size, as they have N − 1 local channels.)\n\nIn this chapter, we consider how in general the rest of the system can cope with a crash of one or more processes, if at all possible. The next chapter will consider the more severe type of what is called a Byzantine failure, where a process may show behavior that is not in line with the specification of the distributed algorithm being executed. The challenge we pose to the system is to let its processes agree on a single value, even though some processes may have crashed. The consensus problem is that the correct processes, meaning the processes that have not crashed (or, in the next chapter, that are not Byzantine), must eventually uniformly decide for the same value. In a crash consensus algorithm to solve this problem, each process randomly chooses an initial value from some finite data domain. In all executions of a crash consensus algorithm, the following three properties must be satisfied:\n\n• Termination: Every correct process eventually decides for a value.   \n• Agreement: All correct processes decide for the same value.   \n• Validity: If all processes choose the same initial value, then all correct processes decide for this value."

It turns out that in this setting one cannot hope to develop a terminating 1- crash consensus algorithm. No matter how large the network is, the prospect of one crashing process suffices to yield infinite executions in which no decision is ever made. The basic idea behind this impossibility result is that a decision for either 0 or 1, in an asynchronous setting, must be enforced by an event at a single process p . But what if p crashes immediately after this event, and in the case of a send event, the message travels through the channel for a very long, indefinite amount of time? Then, at some moment in time, the remaining processes should organize themselves to mimic the decision of p but without any input from this crashed process.

We distinguish γbetween two cases:\n\nThe transitions γ → γ 0 and γ → γ 1 correspond to events a 0 and a 1 at different processes p 0 and p 1 , γrespectively. Then in γ 0 γthe event a 1 at p 1 can still be performed, and likewise in γ 1 the event a 0 at p 0 can γstill be performed. Performing a 1 at p 1 in γ 0 and performing a 0 at p 0 in γ 1 γlead to the same configuration δ , because in both cases the resulting configuration is reached from γ by performing the concurrent events a 0 and a 1 at p 0 and p 1 . So there are transitions γ 0  δ and γ 1  δ . Hence, γ 0 or γ 1 is bivalent, if δ can lead to a decision 1 or 0, respectively. The transitions γ → γ 0 and γ → γ 1 correspond to events at the same process p . In γ , p can crash. Moreover, γa message sent by p γ γ γ γcan take indefinitely long to reach its destination. Therefore, in γ the processes other than p must be 0-potent or 1-potent. In a configuration, a set s of processes is said to be b -potent, for some b ∈ { 0 , 1 } , if by executing only events at processes in s , some process in s can decide for b . Since γ → γ 0 and γ → γ 1 concern p , in γ 0 and γ 1 the processes other than p are still b -potent. So γ 1 − b is bivalent.\n\nIn conclusion, a bivalent configuration can always make a transition to some bivalent configuration.

This is shown to be impossible, if crashes cannot be observed.\n\nTheorem 12.1 There is no (always correctly terminating) algorithm for 1-crash consensus."

We argue that γ 0 or γ 1 γ γ γ γmust be bivalent. We distinguish γbetween two cases:\n\nThe transitions γ → γ 0 and γ → γ 1 correspond to events a 0 and a 1 at different processes p 0 and p 1 , γrespectively. Then in γ 0 γthe event a 1 at p 1 can still be performed, and likewise in γ 1 the event a 0 at p 0 can γstill be performed. Performing a 1 at p 1 in γ 0 and performing a 0 at p 0 in γ 1 γlead to the same configuration δ , because in both cases the resulting configuration is reached from γ by performing the concurrent events a 0 and a 1 at p 0 and p 1 . So there are transitions γ 0  δ and γ 1  δ . Hence, γ 0 or γ 1 is bivalent, if δ can lead to a decision 1 or 0, respectively. The transitions γ → γ 0 and γ → γ 1 correspond to events at the same process p . In γ , p can crash. Moreover, γa message sent by p γ γ γ γcan take indefinitely long to reach its destination. Therefore, in γ the processes other than p must be 0-potent or 1-potent. In a configuration, a set s of processes is said to be b -potent, for some b ∈ { 0 , 1 } , if by executing only events at processes in s , some process in s can decide for b . Since γ → γ 0 and γ → γ 1 concern p , in γ 0 and γ 1 the processes other than p are still b -potent. So γ 1 − b is bivalent.\n\nIn conclusion, a bivalent configuration can always make a transition to some bivalent configuration. Since the crash consensus algorithm has a bivalent initial configuration (see exercise 12.1), it follows that there is an infinite execution, visiting only bivalent configurations. ⊓⊔"

      "Overall_Summary": "The FLP Impossibility Result, named after Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson, is a foundational theorem in distributed computing. It states that in a fully asynchronous system where communication delays are unbounded, there is no deterministic algorithm that can solve the consensus problem while tolerating even a single crash failure. The proof relies on the concept of a 'bivalent' configuration—a system state from which the final decision could still be either 0 or 1. The proof demonstrates that any such algorithm must start in a bivalent state and that from any bivalent state, there is always a sequence of events that leads to another bivalent state. This allows for the construction of an infinite execution where no decision is ever made, thus violating the termination property required for consensus. The significance of this result is profound: it proves that guaranteeing both correctness (agreement) and progress (termination) is impossible without stronger assumptions, such as partial synchrony, randomization, or the use of failure detectors."

To mimic a FIFO channel, a simple protocol suffices, which typically provides a sequence number to each message. (Special care is required if these numbers overflow, meaning that they go outside the available range of integers.) However, for the purposes of this book, it is important to study the fully asynchronous nature of distributed algorithms, which comes to light in a setting with non-FIFO channels.

The problem of failures can be alleviated by including redundancy and replication in the system and letting processes negotiate before a certain action is taken. A typical example is a database management system in which the processes collectively decide whether to commit or abort a distributed transaction (see section 16.2). In sections 3.3 and 6.5, crashed processes were already considered for the specific challenges of rollback recovery and termination detection. A basic assumption we made in those two sections and also in the current chapter is that the network topology is complete. This guarantees that the network topology always stays strongly connected, even when processes have crashed. (Thus it is reasonable to assume that processes know the network size, as they have N − 1 local channels.)\n\nIn this chapter, we consider how in general the rest of the system can cope with a crash of one or more processes, if at all possible. The next chapter will consider the more severe type of what is called a Byzantine failure, where a process may show behavior that is not in line with the specification of the distributed algorithm being executed. The challenge we pose to the system is to let its processes agree on a single value, even though some processes may have crashed. The consensus problem is that the correct processes, meaning the processes that have not crashed (or, in the next chapter, that are not Byzantine), must eventually uniformly decide for the same value. In a crash consensus algorithm to solve this problem, each process randomly chooses an initial value from some finite data domain. In all executions of a crash consensus algorithm, the following three properties must be satisfied:\n\n• Termination: Every correct process eventually decides for a value.   \n• Agreement: All correct processes decide for the same value.   \n• Validity: If all processes choose the same initial value, then all correct processes decide for this value."

The problem of failures can be alleviated by including redundancy and replication in the system and letting processes negotiate before a certain action is taken. A typical example is a database management system in which the processes collectively decide whether to commit or abort a distributed transaction (see section 16.2). In sections 3.3 and 6.5, crashed processes were already considered for the specific challenges of rollback recovery and termination detection. A basic assumption we made in those two sections and also in the current chapter is that the network topology is complete. This guarantees that the network topology always stays strongly connected, even when processes have crashed. (Thus it is reasonable to assume that processes know the network size, as they have N − 1 local channels.)\n\nIn this chapter, we consider how in general the rest of the system can cope with a crash of one or more processes, if at all possible. The next chapter will consider the more severe type of what is called a Byzantine failure, where a process may show behavior that is not in line with the specification of the distributed algorithm being executed. The challenge we pose to the system is to let its processes agree on a single value, even though some processes may have crashed. The consensus problem is that the correct processes, meaning the processes that have not crashed (or, in the next chapter, that are not Byzantine), must eventually uniformly decide for the same value. In a crash consensus algorithm to solve this problem, each process randomly chooses an initial value from some finite data domain. In all executions of a crash consensus algorithm, the following three properties must be satisfied:\n\n• Termination: Every correct process eventually decides for a value.   \n• Agreement: All correct processes decide for the same value.   \n• Validity: If all processes choose the same initial value, then all correct processes decide for this value."

For instance, in termination detection they need to come to the conclusion that an execution of a basic algorithm has terminated. Therefore the negative results presented in this chapter and the next, on the impossibility of solving consensus in the presence of crashing or Byzantine processes, have significant practical implications. And the presented consensus algorithms are at the basis of important practical consensus algorithms such as Paxos and Raft."

      "Overall_Summary": "Consensus is a fundamental problem in distributed computing where a group of processes must agree on a single value, even if some processes fail. A correct consensus algorithm must satisfy three key properties. First, **Agreement**, a safety property, ensures that all correct processes decide on the exact same value, preventing system inconsistency. Second, **Termination**, a liveness property, guarantees that every correct process will eventually reach a decision, ensuring the system makes progress. Third, **Validity** ensures the decision is not trivial by requiring that if all correct processes start with the same value, they must decide on that value. The core challenge and significance of consensus lies in achieving these properties with **fault tolerance**, i.e., in the presence of process failures like crashes or malicious Byzantine behavior. This makes consensus critical for building reliable and consistent distributed systems, from databases to blockchains."

Suppose a occurs at process p and b occurs at process q . Since b is presnapshot, q has not yet received a ⟨ marker ⟩ message at the time it performs b . Since channels are FIFO, this implies that p has not yet sent a ⟨marker⟩ message to q at the time it performs a . Hence, a is presnapshot. Second, a basic message is included in the channel state of p q if and only if its send event at p is presnapshot and its receive event at q is postsnapshot.

      "Overall_Summary": "The Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm is a fundamental protocol for recording a consistent global state of a distributed system without pausing its execution. A global state consists of the local states of all processes plus all messages in transit. The algorithm's correctness hinges on the assumption that communication channels are FIFO. The process is initiated by a node taking a snapshot of its own state and sending a special `<marker>` message along all its outgoing channels. When any other node receives a marker for the first time, it records its own state and propagates the marker. The state of a channel `pq` is captured by node `q` as all messages received from `p` between the moment `q` recorded its own state and the moment it received the marker from `p`. This elegant use of markers ensures that the final collection of local and channel states forms a consistent global snapshot, preventing anomalies like lost or orphan messages."

Its main drawback is the high message cost. **Lamport's Bakery algorithm**, designed for shared-memory systems, simulates a take-a-number system.

For simplicity, we assume that the network topology is complete. Processes are indexed: p ₀ , . . . , p ₙ ₋ ₁ . When a process p ᵢ , . . . ,wants to enter its critical section, it asks permission from all other processes by broadcasting the message ⟨ request , t s ᵢ , i ⟩ with t s ᵢ its logical time stamp, i.e., the logical time of its last event (initially it is zero). The , ,smaller the time stamp of the request, the higher its priority. The second argument of this message, the index i , is meant to break ties between competing processes that happen to send concurrent requests with the same time stamp. Then the request from the process with the lowest index has the higher priority. When another process p ⱼ receives p ᵢ ’s request, it sends permission to p ᵢ as soon as\n\n• p ⱼ is not privileged, and p ⱼ does not have a pending request with a logical time stamp t s ⱼ , where ( t s ⱼ , j ) < ( t s ᵢ , i ) (with respect to the lexicographical order).\n\nProcess p ᵢ enters its critical section when it has received permission from all other processes.

When entering, say, a bakery, each customer gets a ticket with a number, which is increased by 1 with each ticket that follows. The waiting customer with the smallest number is the next to be served.\n\nTo be more precise, the bakery algorithm uses multi-reader single-writer registers choosingi of type Boolean and numberi of type integer, for i = 0 , . . . , N - 1 ; only p ᵢ can write to choosin g ᵢ and numberi. Initially, choosingi = false and n u m b e r ᵢ = 0 ,. A process p ᵢ ,that wants to enter its critical section sets choosin g ᵢ to true, reads the values of the registers numberj for all j ≠ i , writes max { n u m b e r ⱼ | 0 ≤ j < N } + 1 into numberi, and resets choosingi to false. Next, for each j ≠ i , p ᵢ first spins on choosin g ⱼ until it is false and then on numbe r ⱼ until either numbe r ⱼ = 0 or ( n u m b e r ᵢ , i ) < ( n u m b e r ⱼ , j ) .

The **Ricart-Agrawala algorithm** is designed for message-passing systems. It achieves mutual exclusion by having a process broadcast a timestamped request and wait for permission from all other nodes. Priority is determined by the lexicographical order of (timestamp, process ID), ensuring every request is eventually granted. Its main drawback is the high message cost. **Lamport's Bakery algorithm**, designed for shared-memory systems, simulates a take-a-number system. A process chooses a 'ticket' number higher than any other current ticket and then waits its turn based on having the lexicographically smallest (number, process ID) pair. This algorithm guarantees first-come, first-served access without needing special atomic hardware instructions beyond basic reads and writes, but it requires each process to be able to read registers from all other processes."

A quorum is formed by a path from the root to a leaf, with a special rule to handle unavailable nodes by recursively seeking permission from both of their subtrees. This approach provides a degree of fault tolerance, as the failure of a single node does not necessarily block the entire system."

The Agrawal-El Abbadi algorithm implements this by defining quorums as paths in a logical binary tree. **Progress is achieved through careful queue management and ordering.** By granting permissions in a first-come-first-served manner and using a fixed order to resolve requests (e.g., based on position in the tree), the algorithm is starvation-free, provided that no more failures occur.

      "Overall_Summary": "A classic ring-based leader election method is the Chang-Roberts algorithm, designed for directed rings where each process has a unique ID. The algorithm elects the process with the highest ID. The process begins with each candidate (initiator) sending a message with its ID to its neighbor. When an active process `p` receives a message with ID `q`, it compares IDs: if `q` is larger, `p` becomes passive and forwards the message; if `q` is smaller, `p` discards it. If a process receives its own ID back, it declares itself the leader. This ensures only the message with the highest ID circulates completely.\n\nFor a sample execution, consider a counterclockwise ring of processes 0, 1, ..., N-1. If all are initiators, the message from process 0 travels one hop and is discarded by process 1. The message from process 1 travels two hops and is discarded by process 2, and so on. The message from any process `i < N-1` is ultimately stopped by process `N-1`. Only the message from process `N-1` completes the full circle, as no process has a higher ID to stop it. Upon receiving its own message back, process `N-1` becomes the leader."

The Dijkstra-Scholten algorithm is a tree-based method for centralized computations, where it tracks the diffusion of activity by building a dependency tree; termination occurs when the tree is empty. Safra's algorithm is a token-based method suitable for decentralized computations, where a token circulates through the network gathering state information (message counts and process colors) to verify quiescence. Finally, the weight-throwing algorithm uses a conserved quantity; an initial 'weight' is distributed among active processes and messages, and termination is detected when the initiator, in a passive state, reclaims the full weight. Each approach offers a different trade-off between applicability (centralized vs. decentralized), message overhead, and conceptual mechanism."

Privileged processes can take an action that makes their state equal to their predecessor's, effectively passing the privilege. Even if the system starts in a corrupt state with multiple privileged processes, the algorithm's rules ensure that the number of privileges never increases. Eventually, the special process `p_0` will introduce a value unique among all processes, which forces the system to converge to a state where all processes have the same value.

Still, the garbage collection algorithms in the previous section may have reminded you of some of the termination detection algorithms discussed earlier. This is not a coincidence. It turns out that garbage collection algorithms can be transformed into (existing and new) termination detection algorithms. This works as follows. Given a basic algorithm, let each process p host one artificial root object O p . There is also a special nonroot object Z. Initially, only initiators p hold a reference from O p to Z . Each basic message carries a duplication of the Z -reference. When a process becomes passive, it deletes its Z -reference. When a process becomes active, it is told to duplicate a Z -reference, owing to the fact that all basic messages carry a Z - reference.\nThe basic algorithm is terminated if and only if Z is garbage."

The core idea is to model the 'activity' of a computation as references to a special, artificial object 'Z'. An active process or an in-transit message holds a 'reference' to Z. The computation has terminated precisely when Z becomes 'garbage' (i.e., has no more references). A clear example of this is the parallel between the **weighted reference counting** garbage collection algorithm and the **weight-throwing** termination detection algorithm. In weighted reference counting, an object distributes its 'weight' among all references to it and is garbage when all weight is returned. This is functionally identical to weight-throwing, where an initiator distributes 'weight' among all active processes and messages, and termination is detected when all the weight is returned."

The Chandra-Toueg algorithm demonstrates how to solve consensus using an 'eventually weakly accurate' failure detector—one that is imperfect but guarantees that eventually, some correct process will no longer be suspected by others. The algorithm uses a rotating coordinator. The failure detector's guarantee ensures that eventually a correct, unsuspected process will become the coordinator. In that round, all other correct processes will trust it and respond, allowing the coordinator to successfully gather enough acknowledgements to make a decision and break the indecision that plagues purely asynchronous systems."

Recall that in a wait-free algorithm, even if some processes crash, the correct processes are still guaranteed to make progress. Basically this emulation works as follows. Each process holds a copy of the register, containing both its value and a sequence number. At each write operation, the writer increases the sequence number by 1 and broadcasts the new value and the sequence number. Every process that receives this pair stores it and sends back an acknowledgment. The write operation is completed when more than N/2 acknowledgments have been received. A read operation starts by asking all processes (including the reader itself) for their value and sequence number pairs. When more than N/2 such pairs have been received by the reader, it picks the value with the greatest sequence number. It broadcasts this pair and completes the read operation after receiving more than N/2 acknowledgments from readers that they have taken in this pair."

In message passing, physically separate processes communicate by explicitly sending messages over channels without any shared state. In shared memory, typically used in parallel computing, processes communicate implicitly by reading and writing to common memory locations. Although they seem fundamentally different, the text explains that shared memory can be emulated on top of a message-passing system. This is achieved by having each process keep a local copy of a shared register. A write operation involves broadcasting the new value and waiting for acknowledgements from a majority of processes. A read operation involves querying a majority of processes for their value and selecting the one with the most recent sequence number. This demonstrates a deep connection between the two models and shows that algorithms for one can often be adapted for the other."
